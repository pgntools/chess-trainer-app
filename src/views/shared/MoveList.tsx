/**
 * The lichess-style move list: numbered pairs, the current ply highlighted,
 * every move a jump target.
 *
 * A branching game renders here too (CTA-53) — which is what makes this list,
 * behind `TreeMoveList`, the **variations explorer**: its side lines arrive as the
 * optional `branches` prop and hang as indented runs under the mainline move
 * each branches from, inside this list — which is how the Analysis Board's
 * Moves tab shows one list instead of printing the mainline twice, once here
 * and once in the tree that used to sit below it. The props are optional on
 * purpose: a linear game renders exactly as before, so every other consumer
 * passes none.
 *
 * **The list is rendered once per game, not once per step.** The rows and the
 * side lines are memoised on the game; which cell is current, and each move's
 * eval, are read by the cell itself from a selection store
 * (`moveSelection.ts`) that the props are written into. So a step re-renders
 * the cell losing the highlight and the cell gaining it, and an engine message
 * streaming in re-renders none of it — where before, on a ~9,000-node
 * repertoire, each of them redrew every move (CTA-61).
 *
 * Presentational on purpose — the selected ply comes in as a prop and goes out
 * through `onSelectPly`, so `useGameNavigation` owns the state and this renders
 * against a fixture game in tests. It sits in the shell's right-hand aside,
 * *outside* `ForceLTR`: the panel is chrome and mirrors under Hebrew. Only the
 * board is exempt (see the root `CLAUDE.md`).
