/**
 * The promotion picker: the four choices, stacked over the file the pawn is
 * promoting on, with a scrim behind them.
 *
 * `react-chessboard` v5 removed every built-in promotion prop, so this is ours
 * to draw (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §3.5). Hardcoding `promotion: 'q'` is a
 * demo shortcut the two demo boards are allowed and this screen is not — a game
 * you actually play has to be able to underpromote.
 *
 * The pieces are `defaultPieces` from the library, so the choices are drawn in
 * exactly the set the board itself is using.
 *
 * Positioned over the board rather than beside it: the picker overlays the board
 * square, so it is placed in percentages of the board's own box and needs no
 * measurement of the DOM. Column comes from `chessColumnToColumnIndex`, which
 * already accounts for the board being turned around; the stack grows down from
 * the promoting edge, which is the top of the board for the side moving up it.
