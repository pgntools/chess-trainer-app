/**
 * The evaluation bar: a thin vertical strip beside the board, White's share
 * filled from the bottom.
 *
 * The lichess / chess.com placement — flush against the board's edge, inside the
 * screen's own box. It is the board's furniture, not the panel's, so it lives in
 * the square the shell hands the screen and the board gives up its width. The
 * shell's square computation (`Layout.tsx`) is untouched.
 *
 * Two consequences of sitting inside the board square:
 *
 * - **It does not mirror under Hebrew**, because the whole square is wrapped in
 *   `ForceLTR`. That is the right answer for a bar that has to stay welded to a
 *   board which itself never mirrors — a bar that jumped to the far side while
 *   the board stayed put would be reading as a different board's bar.
 * - **It flips with the board.** Turning the board around turns the bar with it,
 *   so the side you are playing is always the end nearest you.
 *
 * Presentational: the score comes in already normalised to White's perspective
 * (`lib/engineAnalysis.ts`), so nothing here has to know whose turn it is.
