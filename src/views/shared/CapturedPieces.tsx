/**
 * One captured-pieces strip: the pieces one side has taken, strongest first,
 * with the material difference beside them while that side is ahead — the
 * lichess / chess.com strip, on every board that plays or analyses a game.
 *
 * Presentational, like everything else in `views/shared/`: it takes props and
 * knows nothing about which screen renders it. Two strips sit on a board's top
 * and bottom edges, outside it — the screen composes them (strip / board /
 * strip) and decides which side each shows, which is why the constants below
 * live here: the strips' height must be accounted exactly, the board box keeps
 * `flexShrink: 0`, and the board gives up their height to stay square
 * (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §5 — the eval bar's width discipline, for
 * height). One file for the arithmetic is the point.
 *
 * A strip with nothing in it still renders: empty strips hold the board's size
 * steady — a queen-vs-rook study with no captures shows two empty strips
 * rather than a board that resizes when the first capture lands.
 *
 * The icons come from `defaultPieces` — or from `pieces`, which the masked
 * screen hands over as the mask's costumes (`lib/pieceMask.ts`), so a captured
 * rook is drawn pixel-identically to how the board draws one. Whatever the
 * icons show, the material difference is the caller's to hide: it is derived
 * from the true types and would leak what a mask exists to hide.
