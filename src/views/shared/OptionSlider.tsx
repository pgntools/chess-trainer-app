/**
 * A slider for one UCI option, rendered from **what the running engine
 * declared** rather than from a list written here.
 *
 * Which options exist, and what they will accept, is a property of the binary in
 * `public/stockfish/` — not of the UCI spec. Asked `uci`, the build shipped here
 * answers with, among others:
 *
 * ```
 * option name Threads type spin default 1 min 1 max 1
 * option name Hash type spin default 16 min 16 max 16
 * option name MultiPV type spin default 1 min 1 max 500
 * option name Skill Level type spin default 20 min 0 max 20
 * ```
 *
 * So `Threads` and `Hash` are not missing — they are **pinned**. A slider that
 * slid from 1 to 4 threads would move and change nothing, and the reader would
 * draw conclusions from it. That is the failure this component exists to avoid,
 * and it needs three states rather than two:
 *
 * | The engine says | The control |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | nothing (no such option) | disabled — "this build has no such option" |
 * | `min` equals `max` | disabled — "this build fixes it at N" |
 * | a real range | live, with *that* range as its bounds |
 *
 * Swapping the binary for a multi-threaded build therefore turns the Threads
 * slider back on with no code change. Both engine screens render their
 * option-backed controls through this one component, which is why it sits in
 * `shared/` — `EngineSettings` (Play with Engine) and `AnalysisSettings` (the
 * Analysis Board) differ in *which* options they show, never in how one is
 * judged.

   * wins, so the control never offers a value the engine would refuse.
