/**
 * The top lines the engine is considering for the position on screen, each with
 * its score and its principal variation in SAN, under the depth the search has
 * reached. Every v2 board pins it above its tabs (`BoardPanel`, CTA-55), where
 * a line is also something the reader plays — see `onSelectMove`; Masked
 * Pieces keeps it behind a switch, off by default, and masks it (CTA-79).
 *
 * Presentational — it takes the analysis the screen collected and renders it, so
 * it can be driven straight from a fixture. Lines arrive one rank at a time and
 * fill in as the search deepens, so a `MultiPV` set with gaps in it is normal;
 * what reaches the screen is the ranks that are both present and still asked
 * for, which is `requested`'s second job (see below).
 *
 * A variation is printed one token per move, the move's number inside the token
 * the way the tree viewer's tokens carry theirs (`VariationLine.tsx`) and a
 * plain space between, so the line reads `23. Nf3 Qe7 24. Rd1`. Collapsed —
 * the default — the row is one line: the score plus as many moves as fit, cut
 * at the edge with an ellipsis by CSS (`white-space: nowrap` +
 * `overflow: hidden` + `text-overflow: ellipsis`), never by counting moves,
 * which would mean measuring the panel (CTA-56, lichess the reference).
 * A chevron at the row's end expands that row to the whole PV, wrapping
 * again; clicking it once more collapses it — lichess's disclosure arrow,
 * so the toggle is an explicit control beside the moves and the score stays
 * the plain text it always was. Rows expand independently, and an expansion
 * belongs to the position it was made on: the same position's
 * search deepening (same FEN) keeps it, a new analysed position starts every
 * row collapsed.
 *
 * The header is the block's own control (CTA-56): a small checkbox where a
 * plain title used to sit — checked by default. Clearing it hides the lines
 * and the waiting line both, the checkbox and the depth chip staying behind
 * as the way back: the reader analysing a position on their own gets the
 * engine's suggestions out of sight without giving up the search itself. It
 * is a working mode rather than an expansion, so it is *not* keyed to the
 * FEN — a new analysed position does not bring the lines back.
 *
 * Whether a *move* is clickable is decided by `onSelectMove` alone — the
 * score's toggle is there either way:
 *
 * - **without it** the moves render as plain text — the two engine screens'
 *   tab, which the reader reads while playing their own moves beside it.
 *   The moves are the DOM text they always were; the row's chevron is still
 *   the expand/collapse button.
 * - **with it** each move is a button, and a click hands over the SAN prefix
 *   up to and including the move clicked — the lichess analysis behaviour:
 *   clicking the third move of a line plays all three. The prefix carries the
 *   *true* SANs even under a mask, because the click is behaviour and the
 *   mask never touches that (`lib/pieceMask.ts`); what the token *prints* is
 *   what is disguised. This holds in both states: a move visible is a move
 *   playable, collapsed or expanded.
 *
 * **The block holds its height while the engine thinks.** It always renders one
 * row per requested line (`requested`): a rank not in yet is a placeholder row
 * of exactly a line row's height — the same box, the same text line, a spacer
 * where the chevron goes — showing "waiting for the engine" in the first row
 * and a skeleton bar in the others. Stepping to a new position clears the
 * analysis, and before this the block fell to one line of text and grew back
 * as the lines landed, jumping everything below it on every step (CTA-61).
 * The "N of M lines" note lives in the header row for the same reason: a line
 * under the grid that comes and goes is a jump of its own.
 *
 * SAN and the scores are Latin text in a panel that mirrors under Hebrew, so
 * every token carries `dir="ltr"` — an **attribute**, never a CSS declaration,
 * which the RTL emotion cache would flip into the bug it is meant to prevent
 * (see the root `CLAUDE.md`). The truncation cuts at the line span's own
 * inline end — the panel's outer edge in English, the side next to the score
 * under Hebrew — which is where the line's LTR span has to clip; the
 * alternative would be mirroring the SAN, and that never happens.

                  baseline with nothing under it. The line span beside it
                  grows to fill the row (below), which is what holds every
                  row's chevron at the row's end, a short line no less than a
                  clipped one. Kept from shrinking, so the clipped line stops
                  short of it, never under it. The label names the variation,
                  the score and the action, because an icon says none of them
                  to a screen reader on its own.
