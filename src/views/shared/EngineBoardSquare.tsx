/**
 * The board square of a screen that plays a game against the engine: the
 * evaluation bar, the board, and the promotion picker overlaid on it.
 *
 * Extracted from Play with Engine when a second screen — Masked Pieces — came
 * to need exactly the same square; every v2 board renders it now, through
 * `BoardShell`. What a board differs by is what is passed in, which for
 * Masked Pieces is a `pieces` renderer (see `lib/pieceMask.ts`). Forking it
 * would have put the width discipline below in two files, to drift apart.
 *
 * Presentational, like everything else in `views/shared/`: it takes props and
 * knows nothing about which screen is rendering it, so neither screen's hook is
 * imported here.
 *
 * ### How the eval bar and the board split the square
 *
 * The shell hands the screen a square of side S and computes it without knowing
 * anything about the bar (`Layout.tsx` is not changed for one). The bar takes a
 * fixed strip out of that square and the board gives up the width, so the board
 * is a `S - EVAL_BAR_TOTAL_PX` square. Bar width + gap must come to exactly that
 * constant, and the board box must have `flexShrink: 0`, or flex shaves the
 * difference off and the board stops being square
 * (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §5). The bar's height is the same computed
 * value rather than `100%`, which is what keeps its ends flush with the board's
 * rather than standing a strip's width taller.
