/**
 * **A position being edited** — the state behind the shared `PositionEditor`
 * (CTA-83; `.claude/rules/position-editor.md`). The host screen owns it, so
 * the position survives the editor being unmounted (a tab switched away) and
 * the host can read it (`fen`, `problems`) or reset it from its own controls.
 * It knows no route, no URL and no screen.
 *
 * ## The board is not a game
 *
 * Every game board owns a *game*: legal moves, played in order, and a
 * `chess.js` instance that is the rules authority. An editor owns neither. Its
 * board is built with `{ skipValidation: true }` and is only ever `put` to and
 * `remove`d from, so it will hold a board with no kings, three queens, or a
 * pawn on the eighth rank — which is the point: you have to be able to take a
 * king off in order to put a different one down. Nothing here asks whether a
 * *move* is legal, because nothing here makes a move.
 *
 * What legality there is gets **reported**, never enforced: `positionProblems`
 * (`lib/positionEditor.ts`) names what is wrong, `isValid` says whether the
 * list is empty, and it is the *host* that switches off whatever takes the
 * position elsewhere (the Lobby's Start). Everything that edits stays live.
 *
 * ## The FEN is split, and only field 1 comes off the board
 *
 * The side to move, the castling rights and the en passant target are panel
 * controls, so they are held here as `PositionFields` and joined back into a FEN
 * on every render. The `chess.js` instance contributes the piece placement and
 * nothing else — it keeps its own idea of the other fields as pieces move
 * around, and that idea is exactly what the reader is overriding. Reading only
 * field 1 off it is what makes those controls round-trip.
 *
 * ## An initial position
 *
 * `initialFen` is read **once** (the first render's value), already validated
 * by the caller. It seeds the board and the fields, turns the board to the
 * side to move (a position is something you are about to answer — root
 * `CLAUDE.md`, "A position turns the board; a game does not"), and is what the
 * third reset, "Reset", returns to. Absent, the standard start, and no third
 * reset.
