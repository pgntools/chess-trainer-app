/**
 * The pieces a side line is drawn with: one clickable move token, and the
 * indented block a side line sits in under the move it answers.
 *
 * Two screens render these, and that is why the file exists (CTA-53): the
 * flowing variation tree (`VariationTree.tsx` — the Openings explorer) and the
 * shared move list (`MoveList.tsx`), which
 * prints each side line as an indented run directly under the row holding the
 * move it branches from — the variations explorer, behind `TreeMoveList`.
 * Same tokens, same clicks, same numbering, one
 * implementation — so the two cannot drift apart the way a copy of this would.
 *
 * Presentational, like everything around it: the selected node comes in as a
 * prop and goes out through `onSelectNode`, and the numbering is read off the
 * tree's start position (`plyLabel`, `lib/gameTree.ts`) rather than assumed to
 * be `1.`.
 *
 * SAN is Latin text sitting in a container that may be RTL: without an
 * explicit direction and its own bidi isolate, "Nf3" and the move numbers get
 * reordered by the surrounding paragraph direction, and a token can bleed into
 * its neighbour. The direction is carried by a `dir="ltr"` **attribute** on
 * each token, not by CSS — under Hebrew these styles go through the RTL
 * emotion cache, whose stylis plugin flips `direction: ltr` into
 * `direction: rtl` exactly as it flips the paddings, and a declaration here
 * would be reversed into the bug it exists to prevent. The attribute is out
 * of that plugin's reach. (`unicode-bidi` is not flipped, and pairs with the
 * attribute the way the HTML default sheet does.) The indentation is
 * `paddingInlineStart`, which follows the reading direction on its own.
 *
 * **What is current, and each move's eval, are not props.** Each token reads
 * them for itself from the list's selection store (`moveSelection.ts`), and
 * everything here is memoised on the tree's own nodes — so a list renders its
 * structure once per game, and a step re-renders the two tokens whose
 * highlight changed rather than every token in a many-thousand-node tree (CTA-61).
 *
 * **A right-click is opt-in** (CTA-64, the variations explorer's move menu):
 * with `onContextMenuNode` a token reports the node and where the pointer was,
 * and the browser's own menu is held back; without it — every consumer but the
 * repertoire player — nothing is bound and a right-click is the browser's. The
 * handler is threaded like `onSelectNode` and must be as stable, or the
 * memoised blocks re-render.
 */

/*
  The token and the block are **two styled elements**, not a `ButtonBase` and a
  `Box` with an `sx` each. A repertoire can carry nine thousand of them, and a
  per-instance `sx` is a style object resolved per instance on mount, while a
  styled element's class is computed once and shared. The look is
  `moveTokenSx.ts`'s — the same spacing, monospace SAN and highlight the other
  token renderers use — and the highlight hangs off `aria-current`, the
  attribute the token already carries for assistive technology, so being
  current is one attribute on one element rather than a different style.
