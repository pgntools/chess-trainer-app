/*
  The Development section's whole persistence promise (CTA-60, acceptance
  criterion 7): a dev board writes to dev-prefixed keys through the *shipped*
  record-store factory and normalisers, so autosave and resume are genuinely
  exercised while a v2 bug can never damage a real saved game or analysis.

  Which means the assertion that matters is an assertion about **isolation**,
  in both directions, and it is worth making explicitly rather than trusting
  two string constants to stay different.
