/**
 * **The panel skeleton every v2 board shares** — §3.2 of
 * [`.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md`](../../../../.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md).
 *
 * One component, every v2 board its consumer. This is the layer that had no
 * owner before CTA-60, and it is the reason that issue existed: the pinned
 * best-variations block lived in `AnalysisPanel` alone, so CTA-55 reached one
 * screen of five and every later change to it would have had to be applied
 * four more times.
 *
 * ```

 *
 * ## The two rules it keeps for every consumer
 *
 * **One tab is rendered at a time**, rather than all of them with the inactive
 * ones hidden: a move list scrolls its selection into view, and a hidden copy
 * would be scrolling a zero-height box on every move.
 *
 * **Unless the screen names it in `keepMounted`.** A tab listed there is
 * mounted the first time it is opened and then *stays* mounted, hidden, while
 * another tab shows — for a body whose mount is the expensive part, like the
 * move list of a 9,000-node repertoire (CTA-61), where remounting on every
 * switch back cost most of a second. Each kept tab has a scrolling region of
 * its own, so it keeps its own place; a hidden token's `scrollIntoView` is a
 * no-op, so nothing scrolls a zero-height box; and when the tab shows again,
 * the panel scrolls its current move (`aria-current`) back into view, since
 * the selection may have moved while it was hidden.
 *
 * **The panel is a non-scrolling flex column and exactly one child scrolls.**
 * The shell's aside does not scroll (`Layout.tsx`) and `RightPanel` portals
 * into a `display: contents` host, so `flex: 1` + `minHeight: 0` +
 * `overflowY: auto` on the tab region is what keeps a long move list off the
 * board square. Every other child is `flexShrink: 0`.
 *
 * ## The variations block, and what makes it clickable
 *
 * The same shared `BestVariations` the two shipped engine screens render as a
 * plain tab. The whole difference is {@link BoardPanelProps.onPlayVariation}:
 * with it, each move is a click that plays the line's prefix up to it (CTA-55,
 * lichess analysis behaviour); without it the moves are plain text. It is
 * capped and scrolls inside itself, because a wide `MultiPV` is ten lines in a
 * narrow panel, and it renders **nothing while the engine is off** — the status
 * row below already says so honestly, and "waiting for the engine" would be a
 * lie about a switch the reader turned off themselves.
 *
 * A board with no engine passes no `analysis` at all, and then neither the
 * block nor the status row exists. Nothing else about the skeleton changes.
