/**
 * **Play — the engine playing the opponent's side** (CTA-73, shared since
 * CTA-74). The Analysis Board's header toggle, lifted out so Play with Engine
 * runs the same copy rather than a second one.
 *
 * The reader plays the side at the bottom of the board (`orientation`), the
 * engine the other. While `playing` is on — and the engine is — a finished
 * search of the position on screen ({@link onBestMove}, handed to
 * `useEngineModule`) is played there, under the node on screen, when it is the
 * engine's side to move; on the reader's turn nothing moves.
 *
 * **It pauses itself** on anything that is not the game going on:
 *
 * - a step that is not one move forward — back, Home, a click on an earlier
 *   move, ↑ / ↓ to another line, a load: the reader has gone to look or to try
 *   something, and goes on by hand until pressing Play again. A move played
 *   (the reader's or the engine's) is a step to a child of the node that was on
 *   screen, and keeps it on;
 * - a **change of side** (the board flipped): the engine's side has changed
 *   under it, and nothing would search the position again to answer it;
 * - the engine switched off, the position over, or the game ended some other
 *   way the screen knows of (`finished` — a resignation).
 *
 * Each is adjusted during render against what was last seen, not in an effect
 * (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`).
 *
 * Pressing Play at the engine's turn with a search of that position already
 * finished plays its first move at once ({@link toggle}), rather than waiting
 * for a search that has already ended.
