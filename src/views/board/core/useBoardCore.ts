/**
 * **The base of every v2 board** — §9.1 of
 * [`.claude/rules/chessboard.md`](../../../../.claude/rules/chessboard.md).
 *
 * Everything every board has, and nothing any single board has: the game as a
 * {@link GameTree}, node-based navigation over it, the `chess.js` rules oracle,
 * the promotion picker, the orientation, and the FEN of the position on screen.
 * The engine, the opening book and persistence are **capability modules** the
 * screen composes beside this hook (`useEngineModule`, `useOpeningBookModule`,
 * `useAutosave`) — never flags inside it.
 *
 * ## Why a tree
 *
 * A tree is the general case and a linear game is the degenerate one.
 * `mainlineGame` / `treeFromGame` bridge both directions and are tested both
 * ways, so a screen that reads one line loses nothing by holding a tree. Every
 * board branches: both colours move from any node, and a move from an earlier
 * position is a side line there.
 *
 * ## The node is the state; the ply is derived
 *
 * Through the shipped `useTreeNavigation`: clicking a move inside a side line
 * does not move along the current line, it changes *which line is current*, and
 * no ply can say that. Everything ply-shaped still comes out, so the shared
 * `BoardControls` drive a tree unmodified.
 *
 * ## Every arrival is initial state
 *
 * `fen`, `tree`, `ply`, `nodeId`, `orientation` and `dirty` are read on the
 * **first render only**: arriving at a URL is what mounts the screen, so there
 * is no later change to follow, and reading one in an effect would mean writing
 * state from one. A parameter that will not parse is the caller's to reject; it
 * arrives here as `undefined`.
 *
 * And the project's rule about which of them turns the board: **a position
 * turns the board, a game does not.** An arriving `fen` faces the side to move;
 * an arriving `tree` opens at ply 0 facing White, because a PGN's side to move
 * at ply 0 says nothing about which side is being studied. A reopened record is
 * neither — it brings its own `orientation`, because coming back to your own
 * board should not turn it around.
