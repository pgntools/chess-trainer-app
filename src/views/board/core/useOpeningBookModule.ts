/**
 * **The opening-book capability** — §2.2 of
 * [`.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md`](../../../../.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md).
 *
 * The eco.json lookup for the position on screen, its known continuations, and
 * their arrows. A board composes this when it lists book continuations;
 * the Openings explorer (`views/openings/`, CTA-78) is the one that does
 * ([`.claude/rules/openings-explorer.md`](../../../../.claude/rules/openings-explorer.md)).
 *
 * Two things worth knowing:
 *
 * - **Disabled, it loads nothing.** The book is ~3MB across five shards, and a
 *   board that does not list continuations must not pull it in. (The *name* of
 *   the position is a different job, and the shared `CurrentOpening` does it
 *   with its own cached load — so a board that only wants the name does not
 *   need this module at all.)
 * - **The arrows are the whole external set.** Arrows passed through
 *   `options.arrows` are controlled: the board never clears or adds to them
 *   itself (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §3.4), so this recomputes the
 *   complete set on every position and every hover.
