/**
 * Board Editor — set a position up piece by piece, then take it somewhere.
 *
 * The screen fills two of the shell's regions and draws no columns of its own:
 *
 * - the **board square** holds the black palette, the board and the white
 *   palette, stacked;
 * - the **right-hand panel** (`<RightPanel>`) holds `EditorPanel` — the
 *   Position / FEN / PGN tabs over the reset controls and the two hand-offs.
 *
 * `/tools/editor?fen=<position>` opens on that position — the mate detail page
 * and any other screen holding a FEN hand one over exactly the way this screen
 * hands one out. The parameter is validated here (`parseFen` is the gate, and
 * one that will not pass it is ignored rather than allowed to throw on someone
 * else's mistyped link) and the hook takes it as its *initial* state, so nothing
 * is written from an effect.
 *
 * All the behaviour lives in `useBoardEditor`; this component is the layout, the
 * board options, and the ingestion state that the two forms and the drop targets
 * share. `<RightPanel>` portals the panel out of this tree, so it still shares
 * this screen's state by closure and nothing is threaded through the shell.
 *
 * ### Why a `ChessboardProvider` rather than a plain board
 *
 * Spare pieces have to be able to reach the board's drag context, and the only
 * way they can is from inside the provider — so every prop the board would have
 * taken goes to the provider's `options` instead and `<Chessboard />` takes none
 * (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §2, and the vendored `SparePieces` story). The
 * palettes are inside it for the same reason, which conveniently puts them
 * inside `Layout.tsx`'s `ForceLTR` as well: they must not mirror, for exactly
 * the reason the board must not.
 *
 * ### How the palettes and the board split the square
 *
 * The shell hands this screen a square of side S and knows nothing about a
 * palette (`Layout.tsx` is not changed for one). The palettes take a fixed strip
 * out of the top and the bottom, and the board gives up the difference — so the
 * board is a `S - PALETTES_TOTAL_PX` square, and that constant is the sum of the
 * two palette heights and the two gaps. The board's box is sized by **width**
 * and squared with `aspectRatio` rather than being given both sides in percent:
 * the provider sits between this box and the shell's square, and a percentage
 * height would have to resolve through it.
