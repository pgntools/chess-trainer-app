/**
 * Openings — a regular board the reader plays through, with the opening
 * eco.json recognises at the position on screen, an arrow and a list entry
 * for every *book* continuation from there, and a variation tree behind it
 * all: stepping back and playing a different move keeps both continuations,
 * exactly as the Analysis Board does.
 *
 * The screen fills two of the shell's regions and draws no columns of its own:
 *
 * - the **board square** holds the board and nothing else, exactly like Load
 *   PGN — there is no eval bar and no palette competing for the width;
 * - the **right-hand panel** (`<RightPanel>`) holds `OpeningsPanel` — the
 *   current opening, the explorer list, a tab over the move list, and the
 *   board controls.
 *
 * ### Arriving with a position
 *
 * `/openings?fen=<position>` opens on that position — the same `?fen=`
 * hand-off the Board Editor, Play with Engine and the Analysis Board already
 * take (see the root `CLAUDE.md`, "An editor owns a position, not a game").
 * This screen does not replay anything, so unlike the `?game=` hand-off it
 * only ever needs the position — which is exactly what the screens that link
 * here (every game screen's opening line, the Board Editor) already have on
 * screen at the ply the reader is looking at.
 *
 * Validated with `parseFen` and taken as *initial* state, like every other
 * screen that reads this parameter: a link nobody can read opens on the
 * starting position instead of throwing.
 *
 * ### Arriving with a saved opening
 *
 * `/openings?openings=<id>` reopens a saved opening — the whole tree (side
 * lines and all), the orientation it was viewed from, and its note, which is
 * shown read-only (editing happens on the Saved openings screen). The id is
 * resolved against the store with `findSavedOpening`; one that is not there
 * reopens as a fresh board, exactly as an unreadable `?fen=` does.
