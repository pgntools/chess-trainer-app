/**
 * **Saved openings** — every position the reader has saved on the Openings
 * screen, newest first, filed into a tree of folders (CTA-40) and each with
 * somewhere to take it.
 *
 * It is [`views/tools/analysis/saved/SavedAnalyses.tsx`](../../analysis/saved/SavedAnalyses.tsx)
 * again, in the Tools folder beside the screen whose output it lists — the same
 * two views over the same caption shape, the same export, the same rule that a
 * record the store has and the PGN cannot parse is still listed so it can still
 * be removed. The view machinery is the shared saved-list module
 * (`views/shared/savedList.ts` and the `SavedList*` beside it), which all three
 * saved screens consume. What is written out below is the one place an opening
 * is **not** an analysis: the record carries a **note** instead of players, so
 * the note is what a row is named by and what is editable here (through the
 * shared `NoteDialog`), and a pick **persists across folder navigation** —
 * select-all in a folder *adds* that folder's openings, the chip counts the
 * whole picked set, and each folder row and card carries a download of the
 * whole subtree, the same set its count stands for.
 *
 * The screen is split into debuggable pieces: the folder browsing is the
 * [`useFolderBrowser`](./useFolderBrowser.ts) hook, the rows and cards are
 * [`SavedOpeningViews.tsx`](./SavedOpeningViews.tsx) and
 * [`SavedFolderViews.tsx`](./SavedFolderViews.tsx), the breadcrumb and the
 * dialog stack are their own files beside them, and this file is the state and
 * the wiring — the folder CRUD as the manager (create under the folder the
 * reader is standing in, rename, move anywhere but the folder's own subtree,
 * and delete, which keeps the contents: an empty folder deletes at once, one
 * with contents asks first, and its openings become Unfiled while its
 * sub-folders re-parent to its own parent).
 *
 * | Destination | Carries | Because |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Openings | `?openings=<id>` | it is the only screen that can go on *exploring* the tree, and the id is what restores the side lines, the orientation and the note |
 * | Play with Engine | `?fen=` at the end of the mainline | it replays nothing; what it wants is the position being looked at |
