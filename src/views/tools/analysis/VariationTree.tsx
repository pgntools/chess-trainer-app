/**
 * The flowing move list for a game that branches: the mainline as a run of
 * numbered moves, and every side line indented under the move it answers —
 * the way a book or lichess prints a variation.
 *
 * The Analysis Board no longer renders this (CTA-53): its Moves tab is one
 * merged list — the shared `MoveList`, with each side line hanging under the
 * mainline move it branches from. The screen that reads a *flowing* line
 * still does: the Openings explorer, where the whole tree is the content and there is no numbered-pairs grid beside it.
 * The move pieces themselves live in `views/shared/VariationLine.tsx`, shared
 * with `MoveList`, so the two renderings cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Presentational, like its sibling: the selected node comes in as a prop and
 * goes out through `onSelectNode`, so `useTreeNavigation` owns the state and
 * this renders against a fixture tree in tests.
 *
 * SAN is Latin text in a panel that mirrors under Hebrew, so every token
 * carries `dir="ltr"` — an **attribute**, never a CSS declaration, which the
 * RTL emotion cache would flip into the bug it is meant to prevent (see the
 * root `CLAUDE.md`). The indentation is `paddingInlineStart`, which follows
 * the reading direction on its own.
 *
 * The tokens are rendered **once per tree**: which one is current is read by
 * each token from a selection store (`views/shared/moveSelection.ts`), so a
 * step re-renders the two tokens whose highlight changed, not the tree.
