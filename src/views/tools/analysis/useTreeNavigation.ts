/**
 * Where the analysis board is standing in a {@link GameTree}: which node is
 * selected, the position and highlight that follow from it, the line it sits
 * on, and the keyboard stepping that walks it.
 *
 * ## Why the state is a node, not a ply
 *
 * Clicking a move inside a side line does not move along the current line, it
 * *changes which line is current*. A ply number cannot express that: ply 3 of
 * which line? So the id is the state and the ply is derived from it. What the
 * shared board controls need still comes out: {@link TreeNavigation.ply} and
 * `lastPly` index into {@link TreeNavigation.line}, and `goToPly` walks it,
 * while "the line" quietly follows the reader into a variation.
 *
 * ## The keys
 *
 * ← / → step along the line; **Home / End** jump to its start and end; and
 * **↑ / ↓ cycle through the sibling moves** of the move on screen — the other
 * continuations from the same position, in `children` order, wrapping around
 * (CTA-69). Nothing happens at the start
 * position or on a move with no alternatives. What it is for: with the
 * repertoire player's Autoplay on, the reader swaps the trainer's reply for
 * another of the file's, and moving from there sets the trainer going again
 * — navigation drops nothing it owes, since a reply is owed only after the
 * reader's own move (`useTrainerModule`).
