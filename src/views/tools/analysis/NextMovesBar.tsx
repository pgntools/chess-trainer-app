/**
 * The pinned "next moves" bar (CTA-54): the continuations of the position on
 * screen, two per row with the mainline first — a third way to advance, beside
 * the merged list's rows and the step controls. The panel renders it between
 * the tab's scrolling region and the board controls, so it stays put while the
 * list scrolls.
 *
 * A raised strip of panel rather than more list: one step up from the aside's
 * sunken background (`background.paper`) and outlined, so it reads as its own
 * section — without the fill it blurred into the scrolling list above, whose
 * tokens are drawn with the same shapes as the bar's.
 *
 * Presentational, like the pieces it is drawn with: the continuations arrive as
 * nodes, a click goes out as the node it names — the same selection a
 * side-line token in the merged list makes, so the board, the list highlight
 * and the stepping all follow a click here exactly as they follow one there —
 * and a hover is reported out the same way, because the bar is only half the
 * feature: the screen draws an arrow on the board for every continuation, and
 * the move the pointer is over gets its arrow recoloured
 * (`AnalysisBoard.tsx`, the green→red language of `nextMoveArrows.ts`). The
 * first node is the mainline (`children[0]` at every level,
 * `lib/gameTree.ts`) and prints in the standard text colour; the rest are
 * variations and print dimmed — the lichess colouring CTA-53 established for
 * the merged list.
 *
 * **A fork is two or more continuations, and only a fork renders.** One move or
 * none is a position with nothing to choose between, and a strip of panel
 * reserved for it would push the board controls down for nothing — so this
 * returns `null` and the panel's flex column closes over the gap: no bar, no
 * label, no space. The screen gates the board's arrows on the same fork, so
 * the two halves appear and vanish together.
 *
 * **The play chances can print beside the SAN** (CTA-71): `Nf3 97.8%` — the
 * lichess explorer's own grammar for the same idea, and the one encoding of a
 * chance that needs no legend and reads under every kind of colour blindness.
 * The chances arrive as the very array the board's arrows take
 * (`nextMoveArrowsOf`'s third argument), so the number a token prints and the
 * colour of its arrow are one fact, never two. Optional, and an `undefined`
 * entry prints that move's SAN alone — a branch with no marks keeps today's
 * bar, as its arrows keep the green and blue.
 *
 * SAN is Latin text in a panel that may be RTL: each token carries the
 * `dir="ltr"` **attribute**, never a CSS direction declaration — under Hebrew
 * the panel's styles go through the RTL emotion cache, whose stylis plugin
 * flips `direction: ltr` into the bug it exists to prevent, and the attribute
 * is out of its reach (`VariationLine.tsx` has the full story). The grid
 * mirrors with the panel, so the reading order — mainline first — follows the
 * direction on its own.
