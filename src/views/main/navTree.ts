 * key, which is what an authored screen or folder carries — the app ships those
 * strings and `locales.test.ts` asserts both catalogs have them. `label` is a
 * per-language `{ en, he }` carried by data, for a node whose name is content
 * rather than chrome — a name nobody should need a locale edit for, and which
 * has no catalog key to assert. Nothing ships one today; the tests nest
 * fixtures that do. Exactly one of the two; `navLabel` reads whichever is
 * there and `navLabelKeys` reports only the first kind.

 * a second click, a second copy of the name, and nothing inside it but the one
 * screen. So the sidebar renders it as just that screen.
 *

 *
 * - a category that also holds **sub-folders** keeps its folder, and its own
 *   list screen sits alongside them (two-or-more children — untouched);
 * - a **group** of several categories keeps its folder too — once its own
 *   leaf children have folded down to screens it holds several of them,
 *   which is again two-or-more children.
 *
 * Applied **below the top level only**: the top-level rows are app-area
 * groupings (Engine, Library, Repertoires…), not categories. A top-level folder is
 * folded only by the other rule — `foldSingleEntryFolders`, for a folder
 * marked as one destination — so every level is folded by exactly one of the

 *
 * An app-area folder can be one destination rather than a grouping: the

 * expands to a single link is two clicks and a second row on the way to it.
 * Marked `singleEntry` in `navFolders.ts`, it renders as just that screen —
 * one clickable row, named by the **folder** (the folder's name is what the
 * reader navigates by, and the screen's own label says what is inside it, so
 * showing both would read the same thing twice) — carrying the folder's icon,
 * and navigating to the screen's route.
 *
 * Applied **at the top level only** — the counterpart of
 * `collapseLeafCategory`'s below-the-top-level-only rule, so every level is
 * folded by exactly one of the two. A top-level screen row has no folder
 * ancestors, so its exact-pathname active state shows with nothing opened.
 *
 * Fires on the same shape test the leaf fold applies — one child, and it is a
 * screen. A `singleEntry` folder that does not match (two screens, or a
 * sub-folder) stays a folder and the flag sits inert, the same way a
 * mis-shaped leaf category does.
