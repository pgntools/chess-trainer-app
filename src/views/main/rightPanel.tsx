/**
 * The app shell's right-hand panel slot.
 *
 * `Layout.tsx` renders one aside next to the board square. It used to hold a
 * hardcoded Analysis placeholder; this module turns it into a slot a route can
 * fill with its own content — a move list, an evaluation panel — while every
 * route that fills nothing keeps seeing the placeholder.
 *
 * Three components, and nothing else, make up the API:
 *
 * | Export | Rendered by | Purpose |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `RightPanelProvider` | the shell, above the router `<Outlet />` | owns the slot |
 * | `RightPanelOutlet`   | the shell, inside its aside | renders whatever a route registered, or `fallback` |
 * | `RightPanel`         | **a route/screen** | registers its children into the aside |
 *
 * A screen uses it like this — no props to thread, no shell edit:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { RightPanel } from '../main/rightPanel';
 *
 * function SomeGameScreen() {
 *   const [moves, setMoves] = useState<Move[]>([]);
 *   return (
 *     <>
 *       <Chessboard options={…} />
 *       <RightPanel>
 *         <MoveList moves={moves} />   // shares this screen's state by closure
 *       </RightPanel>
 *     </>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### How it works, and why it is built this way
 *
 * The registered content is **portalled** into a host element the outlet
 * renders, rather than lifted into shell state. A screen sits *below* the
 * shell in the tree, so pushing an element upwards would mean writing shell
 * state from a child effect on every render — and since a shell re-render
 * re-renders the screen, which mints a fresh element, that is a render loop.
 * With a portal the content stays part of the screen's own tree: it re-renders
 * with the screen, and React unmounts it (restoring the fallback) when the
 * route changes. Nothing is written to shell state on a content change.
 *
 * What the shell *does* need to know is whether anyone is registered at all,
 * so it can choose between the panel and the fallback. That single bit lives
 * in a small external store read through `useSyncExternalStore` — React's own
 * escape hatch for state that changes outside render — instead of a `useState`
 * written from an effect, which `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rejects and
 * which would cascade an extra render on every screen re-render.

        churn through the store, and it only stays harmless by accident.
      - Passing `slot.setHost` into `ref` makes `react-hooks/refs` treat the
