/**
 * **The variations explorer, for every v2 board** — the shared `MoveList`
 * over a {@link GameTree}, with each side line hanging as an indented run
 * under the mainline move it branches from. (It was "the merged move list"
 * when CTA-53 introduced it; CTA-64 gave it its move menu and its name;
 * CTA-72 moved it out of `views/dev/core/` into the shared explorer, whose
 * Moves part it is — `useVariationsExplorer` renders it, and a screen that
 * wants only the list may render it directly, as the dev boards do.)
 *
 * It exists because of the **ply↔node seam**. The list speaks plies over the
 * mainline; the navigation state is a node id, because a click inside a side
 * line changes *which line is current* and no number can say that
 * (`useTreeNavigation`). Something has to translate, and before CTA-60 that
 * translation lived inside `AnalysisPanel` — which is exactly why the merged
 * list reached one screen of five. Here it is one component, so the other four
 * get it by composing it.
 *
 * The three rules of the translation, all of them load-bearing:
 *
 * - **A selection that is the start, or a mainline node, is the ply it names.**
 * - **A selection inside a side line is no ply at all**, so `-1` is passed
 *   through and no numbered row of the list highlights. It must not fall back
 *   to 0, which would light the start position while the reader stands
 *   somewhere else entirely.
 * - **A click on a numbered row goes out as the mainline node it names**; a
 *   click on a side-line token goes out as the node *it* names.
 *
 * `children[0]` is the mainline at every level, so everything after it is a
 * side line — which is the whole of how `branches` is built.
 *
 * A move carrying a PGN comment is marked with the comment icon (CTA-69):
 * the mainline's by ply (`annotatedPlies`, built here), a side line's off its
 * own node (`markCommentedNodes`). And the engine's evals are printed on
 * the mainline's cells only (`mainlineEvalsOnly`): a side line reads as a
 * line of moves, not as a column of scores.
 *
 * The optional `extensionIds` (CTA-63) cross the same seam: the list tints
 * side-line tokens by node id and numbered cells by ply, so the mainline's
 * share of the set is translated to plies here, once per change.
 *
 * **It is also the variations explorer** (CTA-64): given `onEditTree`, a
 * right-click on any move opens `MoveContextMenu` — promote, make main line,
 * delete from here, copy the line's PGN — and an edit comes back out as a new
 * tree for the screen to hand its core (`replaceTree`). The seam again: a
 * numbered cell reports a ply, translated here to its mainline node. The two
 * handlers the list receives only set this component's menu state, so they
 * are stable across steps and the memoised list is not re-rendered by one; the
 * menu is a sibling of the list, outside its memo. Without `onEditTree` nothing
 * is bound and a right-click is the browser's — every consumer but the
 * repertoire player.
