/**
 * **The choice a text of many games has to make** — merge them into one
 * repertoire, or split them into one each (CTA-61; the rule is in
 * `lib/savedRepertoires.ts`, "A repertoire is one game").
 *
 * Shown in two places, which is why it is its own component: the upload
 * screen, when what was picked or pasted holds several games, and a
 * repertoire's own route, when the record was saved before the rule and
 * still holds several — then `replacing` is its id, and what the reader picks
 * takes its place in the list (a merge keeps the id, so the URL goes on
 * working), carrying its `settings` over.
 *
 * Merge is offered only when the games share a start position; otherwise the
 * button says why it is off. Split says how many repertoires it makes, and
 * puts them in a folder of their own, named after the text; the reader lands
 * inside it. Both write through `addRepertoires`, all or nothing. The layout
 * is the shared `MergeSplitChoice` (the Analysis Board's Load tab offers the
 * same choice, CTA-73); what each button does is this file's.
