/**
 * **A repertoire, played** (CTA-63) — the one screen behind a repertoire's own
 * view (`/repertoires/<id>`, the **player**) and its games
 * (`/repertoires/<id>/games/<game>`, {@link RepertoireGameId}). The route
 * files (`RepertoireBoard.tsx`, `RepertoireGame.tsx`) resolve the record and
 * hand it here with or without a `game`.
 *
 * Composed from the v2 core
 * ([`.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md`](../../../.claude/rules/chessboard-v2.md)):
 *
 * | Capability | Taken | Because |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Base | `useBoardCore({ orientation })` | facing the reader's side; both colours move from any node — a reader tries moves against the file, and past a line's end plays both |
 * | Trainer | `useTrainerModule` | the opponent: in the player behind the **Autoplay** setting (off by default), always on in a game — see that file for the "replies to a move, never to a position" rule |
 * | Game | `useRepertoireGame` | a game's score, finished lines and coverage; inert in the player |
 * | Engine | switch, **off by default**, **no reply** | the pinned best-variations block and the eval bar when asked for; it never moves a piece |
 * | Autosave | ❌ | the session is the reader's, the record is the file's |
 * | Tree view | `useVariationsExplorer` (`views/explorer/`, CTA-72) | the Moves and Map tabs, the comment block, the next-moves bar and the arrows — the shared explorer, given what is the player's as options ([`.claude/rules/tree-views.md`](../../../.claude/rules/tree-views.md)) |
 *
 * ## The rules of a session — the player and every game
 *
 * - **The reader picks a side** (Settings), defaulting to the repertoire's main
 *   color; the board faces it. Changing side, and "Restart", go back to the
 *   start and **keep** what the reader added.
 * - **Every move the repertoire does not have is an extension** — added under
 *   the node on screen and tinted in the move list; `extensionIdsOf` against
 *   the ids the repertoire arrived with (or last saved), recomputed, never
 *   tracked. The header's download writes them out; the Engine tab's "Clear"
 *   drops them.
 * - **Changes are kept on the reader's say-so** (the player's; a game never
 *   writes). While the session's tree differs from the record, the header's
 *   **Save** button (disabled while nothing has changed) takes the primary
 *   colour, and a click on it opens a strip above the footer
 *   (`RepertoireChangesBar.tsx`) that offers **Update this repertoire**
 *   (`withRepertoireTree`, in place — the session becomes the record, and the
 *   additions stop being additions; on a **protected** repertoire — its
 *   settings, on by default — the strip says so and offers a link to its
 *   settings in Update's place),
 *   **Save as a copy** (`repertoireCopyOf` —
 *   a new record with the original's settings and folder, opened at the
 *   position on screen, the original untouched: how a shipped repertoire
 *   becomes one's own) and **Discard**. A reload with changes unsaved asks
 *   first. Nothing is ever written unasked.
 * - **The Moves tab is the variations explorer** (CTA-64, the player's
 *   only): a right-click on a move promotes its line, makes it the main line,
 *   deletes from it (asking first) or copies its PGN. An edit goes through
 *   the core's `replaceTree`, which keeps the reader where they stand, and is
 *   a session change like any other — the Save button, the strip, the Map
 *   and `?at=` all follow the edited tree. The Map's written moves carry the
 *   same menu (CTA-67), in the tab and full screen, and redraw as it edits.
 * - **Tabs: Moves · (Score) · Map · Settings · Engine.** Settings holds the
 *   side, Autoplay (player only — and the header's **Play** button, a second
 *   control over the same state), the next-move arrows and the engine's
 *   switch; the Engine tab is disabled while the engine is off; Score is a
 *   game's; the Map (the explorer's `TreeMap.tsx`) is the player's — its
 *   dots links to their positions — and Backtracking's, with the coverage.
 *   Get to the end has none.
 * - **The player's URL is a permanent link** to the position on screen:
 *   `?at=<SANs from the start>` (`lib/repertoireLink.ts`), read once when the
 *   tree lands, written back on every step with history replace.
 * - **Arrows are the reader's call**: every continuation at the node on
 *   screen, the mainline's move in its own colour (`nextMoveArrowsOf`). The
 *   player opens as the repertoire's settings say (`showArrows`, on by
 *   default); a game opens without them. The Settings tab switches them for
 *   the session. In the player, hovering the next-moves bar draws the hovered
 *   move's arrow either way.
 *
 * ## A game is the player with rules
 *
 * A game turns the trainer on for good and puts it in **game mode** (`drill`:
 * the reader's moves inside the repertoire judged before they are made, a
 * wrong one taken back, one verdict per position), with a **Score** tab that
 * opens first. The game's own rules come from `useRepertoireGame`:
 *
 * - **Get to the end** — the trainer picks at random; reaching the end of a
 *   line finishes it (counted), and Restart starts another.
 * - **Backtracking** — every line is to be covered. The trainer steers to
 *   uncovered lines; where only some of the reader's moves still lead to one,
 *   those are **required** — a purple arrow and a status line say so, and a
 *   finished line's move is refused (not a failure). When a line ends, play
 *   goes **back** to the deepest position with an uncovered line under it, and
 *   goes on from there until every line is covered. A **Map** tab draws the
 *   repertoire as a tree (`views/explorer/TreeMap.tsx`): covered lines, the rest, and
 *   where the reader is.
 *
 * The tree is parsed after a paint, behind a `setTimeout(0)`: a many-thousand-
 * node repertoire takes about a second.
 */
