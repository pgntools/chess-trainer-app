 * - `import.meta.env.DEV` is replaced by the literal `false` in a production

 * - every screen is reached through `lazy(() => import(…))` rather than a
 *   static import at the top of this file, so with the branch dead there is no
 *   reference to `views/dev/` left for rollup to keep — no dev chunk is
 *   emitted at all, where a static import would have been bundled whether the
 *   route existed or not.
 *
 * `Suspense` is required by `lazy`, and a board screen resolves from the same
 * dev server in a frame, so the fallback is deliberately nothing.
