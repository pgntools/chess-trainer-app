/**
 * The one `localStorage` record-store factory — the machinery every record
 * store in `src/lib/` is built over.
 *
 * A record store keeps one JSON array under one versioned `localStorage` key,
 * one row per record (a [`PlayedGame`](./playedGames.ts), a repertoire, a folder),
 * newest first. Five stores were written by hand with the same scaffolding — a
 * try/catch read, a revision-stamped cached snapshot, a listener set over a
 * `storage`-event subscription, and a write that bumps the revision — and this
 * module is that scaffolding, written once. What a store does *with* the
 * machinery — its caps, its idempotency comparisons, the operations that span
 * two stores — stays in the store's own file, which documents what is
 * different about it, not what is the same.
 *
 * ### Nothing here throws
 *
 * `localStorage` is not a reliable dependency: a browser in private mode can
 * throw on access, another tab can leave something that is not JSON under the
 * key, and a write can exceed the quota. Each of those is answered — an empty
 * list on read, a reported `"storage"` problem on write — because the
 * alternative is a screen that will not render.
 *
 * ### The snapshot is checked against a revision, not against the data
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` calls `getSnapshot` on **every render** and must get
 * the same value back when nothing changed, so the parsed array is cached.
 * What the cache is checked against matters: the records can run to megabytes
 * (the uploads store's snapshot is read from a catalog getter, once per
 * keystroke in a search box), so each write also stamps a short **revision**
 * under a second key — `<storage key>.rev` — and a snapshot reads only that;
 * the data is re-read and re-parsed when the revision moves and at no other
 * time.
 *
 * Keeping the revision in storage rather than in a variable here is what makes
 * the cache self-correcting: another tab's write moves it, and a
 * `localStorage.clear()` — between two tests, or from the browser's own
 * controls — removes it, so the next snapshot goes back to the data and finds
 * it gone.
 *
 * ### A row the normaliser refuses is dropped, not rendered
 *
 * Stored JSON is data from another tab, an older build, or a hand edit. The
 * normaliser — the `savedGameFrom`-style guard each
 * store passes in — is what turns a row back into a record, and a row it does
 * not recognise is dropped rather than handed to a screen as one.
