 *
 * Stockfish reports `score cp` / `score mate` **from the side to move's

 * so the same number means White when it is White's turn and Black when it is
 * Black's. Every display in the app says "up is White" instead, so the score is
 * normalised exactly once, at {@link scoreFromUci}, and everything downstream
 * may assume White's perspective.
