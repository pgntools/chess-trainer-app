 * `lib/gameTree.ts`; this module owns nothing but the parsing, and is one
 * producer of each. Everything here is pure, so the screens and their tests can
 * use it freely.
 *
 * The split between the two parsing steps is deliberate: cutting a file into
 * games is a *text* concern (games are separated by a blank line before the
 * next `[Event ...]` tag pair), while a parser only ever takes one game at a
 * time.
 *
 * ## Two parsers, because they answer different questions
 *
 * {@link parsePgnGames} hands the work to `chess.js` `loadPgn`, which reads the
 * **mainline and discards every `( ... )` side line** — the right answer for a
 * screen that replays one game. {@link parsePgnTrees} keeps them, because an
 * analysis board's whole point is the side lines, so it walks the movetext
 * itself and uses `chess.js` only to decide what each move means in the position
 * it is played from.
