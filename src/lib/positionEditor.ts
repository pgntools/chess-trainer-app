 * A position *being edited*, as data.

 * `lib/fen.ts` answers "is this pasted text a position I can play from" and
 * throws when it is not. A board editor needs the other two questions, and
 * neither of them can throw:
 *
 * - **What are a FEN's fields, separately?** Side to move, castling rights and
 *   the en passant target are three of the six fields, and the editor puts a
 *   control on each. Splitting and rejoining here is what makes those controls
 *   round-trip: the FEN shown is `fenFromFields(fenFields(fen))`.
 * - **What is wrong with this position?** Half-edited boards are illegal by
 *   definition — you have to be able to take a king off in order to put a
 *   different one down — so the editor reports rather than refuses.
 *   `positionProblems` names what is wrong and never throws.
 *
 * Pure, and it holds no `chess.js` instance of its own: the one built for the
 * check test is thrown away with the call. The editor's board instance lives in
 * `views/shared/positionEditor/usePositionEditor.ts`.
