/**
 * Piece masking: which graphic is drawn for which real piece, and how a move
 * reads once the piece that made it is in disguise.
 *
 * The technique is specified in `docs/chess_piece_masking_technique.docx.md`.
 * Two of its clauses are what this module exists to honour:
 *
 * - **§7 — masking is a presentation-layer transformation, not a rules one.**
 *   Nothing here touches `chess.js`, `lib/engine.ts`, `lib/gameModel.ts` or the
 *   PGN path. A masked queen is still a queen to every one of them; the mask is
 *   read at render time and nowhere else.
 * - **§13 — keep the true game state authoritative and separate from the
 *   rendering layer**, and give away no identity through "piece silhouette,
 *   colour, animation, notation, move hints, or engine overlays". The silhouette
 *   is {@link maskedPieces}; the notation is {@link maskSan} (and, for a
 *   tree's move, {@link maskNodeSan}). Where each is applied, and why:
 *   `.claude/rules/masked-pieces.md`.
 *
 * ## Why the mask is keyed on the *type*, not on the piece
 *
 * `chess.js` gives a piece no stable identity — it is a `{ type, color }` read
 * off a square, and the same object comes back after it has moved. Masking
 * *individual* pieces (the doc's "Selected pieces" variant) would therefore need
 * a square → identity map maintained across every move, capture, castle, en
 * passant and promotion: a second source of truth that can drift out of step
 * with the real position, which is exactly what §13 forbids.
 *
 * A type-level mask is a render-time lookup with no state at all. It also makes
 * promotion fall out for free — a pawn that becomes a queen is drawn as whatever
 * a queen is drawn as, because nothing recorded that it used to be a pawn.
 *
 * ## What a mask may not do
 *
 * Colour is *visible* information (doc §3.1); only the type is hidden (§3.2). So
 * a mask entry is expected to point at a piece of the **same colour** — the
 * editor only ever offers those six. The type does not forbid a cross-colour
 * entry, because a `Record` that could would be a twelve-case union nobody can
 * read; the invariant lives in the editor and in {@link MASK_PRESETS}.
