 * **The reader's saved-analysis folders** (CTA-73) — a nested tree, the saved
 * games' model ([`savedGameFolders.ts`](./savedGameFolders.ts)) and the saved
 * openings' before it: a folder is a name and a parent id, the analyses name
 * their folder by `SavedAnalysis.folderId`, `null` is Unfiled.
 *
 * The entity is **the same shape** as a game folder, so it is that type and
 * those reads — the children, the breadcrumb chain, the subtree, the
 * flattened picker list, the normaliser, cycles cut and dangling parents read
 * as the top level — rather than a third copy of them. What is this file's own
 * is the one read that knows what is filed: {@link analysesInFolder}. The
 * storage half is [`savedAnalysisFolderStore.ts`](./savedAnalysisFolderStore.ts),
 * under its own key, so a game folder and an analysis folder never mix.
