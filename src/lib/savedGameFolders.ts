/**
 * **The nested-folder model** — what a folder is, and the tree it nests into.
 *
 * The old Saved games screen's flat list grew into a folder system (CTA-46);
 * that screen, its store and its games are gone (CTA-74, CTA-79), and what
 * stays is this pure half: the {@link GameFolder} entity and the reads over a
 * list of them, which the saved analyses' folders *are*
 * (`savedAnalysisFolders.ts`). A folder is **not** a record of what it holds,
 * which is the whole reason it is a separate record in a separate store: it
 * carries only a name and a parent. What joins the two is a
 * {@link FiledRecord}'s `folderId`, a plain id — no join table, no `children`
 * array on the folder, because a folder's children are derivable from the
 * list and a second copy of them could desync.
 *
 * ## A parent is an id, not a position in a list
 *
 * Nesting is `parentId: string | null` — `null` is the top level. Two rules
 * every helper below applies:
 *
 * - **A `parentId` that does not resolve is treated as `null`.** A hand-edited
 *   or half-deleted store can name a parent that is not there; a folder whose
 *   parent is gone still belongs somewhere, so it reads as top level rather
 *   than vanishing from every list.
 * - **A cycle is a fact about the data, not an error.** `parentId` is plain
 *   JSON; a hand-edited `a → b → a` would send a naive walk into an infinite
 *   loop. Every walk here carries a visited set and stops rather than
 *   recurring — {@link gameFolderPath} starts the cycle's own chain at the
 *   folder it entered it on, and {@link gameFolderSubtree} just stops. The
 *   store's write side prevents cycles from forming in the first place
 *   (`moveGameFolder` refuses a folder's own subtree), so these reads are
 *   defence in depth, not the rule.
