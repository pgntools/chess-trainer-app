 * The shared game model: what a "game" is to everything that displays one.
 *
 * Games are produced from opposite directions — `parsePgnGames` parses an
 * immutable game out of text, `gameFromChess` snapshots one grown move by move
 * in a live `chess.js` instance (Masked Pieces) — and both feed the same move
 * list, the same ply navigation and the same board controls. That is only true because they hand
 * those pieces the *same* type, so the model lives here rather than inside
 * either producer.
 *
 * It is plain data: no React, no live `chess.js` instance handed out. A
 * {@link Game} is a snapshot, and every move carries the position it produced,
 * so a viewer jumps to a ply by reading a FEN rather than by re-simulating.
 *

 * | --- | --- |
