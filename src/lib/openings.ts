 *
 * The published `@chess-openings/eco.json` package downloads this data from

 * `.npmignore` excludes every `*.json`). CTA-30 rules that out: this screen
 * has to work offline and on GitHub Pages, so the data is vendored into the
 * repo and loaded through Vite's own code splitting instead of a `fetch`.
 *
 * The reference for the book — data, loading, lookups, consumers — is
 * [`.claude/rules/openings-explorer.md`](../../.claude/rules/openings-explorer.md) §2.
