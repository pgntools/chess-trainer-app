/**
 * **The tree map** (CTA-63; was `lib/repertoireMap.ts` until CTA-72) — the
 * layout of the variations explorer's Map: a game tree drawn as an SVG, so
 * the reader sees where they are in it and how much of it is left. Pure:
 * coordinates and path strings in, nothing rendered here
 * (`views/explorer/TreeMap.tsx` draws them). It knows nothing of
 * repertoires: a coverage is anything that counts the open lines under a
 * position ({@link MapCoverage}), which Backtracking's `Coverage` is.
 *
 * ## The layout
 *
 * Depth runs left to right — one column per ply — and every **line** (a leaf)
 * gets a row of its own, in the order the tree lists them. A position sits on
 * the row of its **first** child, so `children[0]` continues straight along
 * its parent's row: the mainline is the top row, and each side line drops to
 * the rows below the point it branches from, joined by an elbow. The same
 * reading the merged move list gives, turned into a picture.
 *
 * ## Why path strings, not elements
 *
 * The shipped one-tree example would be nearly eight thousand `<line>` elements. Instead the
 * edges are grouped into one `d` string per kind — covered, open, the path to
 * the reader — so the map is a handful of elements whatever its size, and a
 * step redraws one short path rather than the tree.
