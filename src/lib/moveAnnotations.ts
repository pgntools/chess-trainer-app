/**
 * **What a move's annotations say, ready to read** (CTA-69) — the comments
 * the tree carries (`lib/gameTree.ts`), split into the prose and the
 * **attributes** written inside it, for the repertoire player's comment block.
 *
 * Two kinds of attribute are recognised, both read out of the comment text
 * and taken out of the prose so nothing is said twice:
 *
 * - **PGN embedded commands**, `[%key value]` — lichess' and ChessBase's
 *   `[%eval 0.25]`, `[%clk 0:05:00]`, `[%cal Ge2e4]`, and any other: the key
 *   is the command's name, the value its text, unread.
 * - **An engine's evaluation**, the shape analysis exports end a comment
 *   with — `+/= +1.31 (21 ply)`, `= 0.00 (27 ply)` — as `assessment`,
 *   `eval` and `depth`; and `-+ mate-in-12` as `assessment` and `mate`.
 * - **A play chance**, lichess-tools' `prc:40` (or `[%prc 40]`) — as `prc`,
 *   `"40%"` (`lib/playChance.ts`, where what it does is written down).
 *
 * Pure: the tree is the model, this is only a reading of it. What the tree
 * stores is never changed — a written PGN keeps the comment as it came.
