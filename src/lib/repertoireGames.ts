/**
 * **The repertoire games** (CTA-63) — what a game played over a repertoire is,
 * as pure functions. The screen (`views/repertoires/RepertoirePlayer.tsx`) and
 * the trainer module (`views/board/core/useTrainerModule.ts`) do the playing;
 * this file only answers questions about the repertoire and what has been
 * covered of it.
 *
 * Two games, both played with game mode's rules (every move of the reader's
 * inside the repertoire judged before it is made, a wrong one taken back —
 * `judgeDrop` in `lib/repertoireTrainer.ts`):
 *
 * - **Get to the end** (`end`) — the trainer picks among its moves at random,
 *   as in the player; the reader's goal is to reach the end of a line.
 * - **Backtracking** (`backtrack`) — the goal is to cover **every** line. A
 *   *line* is a leaf of the repertoire as it arrived (a node with no
 *   children), and it is *covered* once play reaches it. Three things follow,
 *   and each is one function here:
 *   - the trainer steers towards lines not yet covered
 *     ({@link backtrackingPolicy});
 *   - at the reader's turn, where only some of their repertoire moves still
 *     lead to uncovered lines, those moves are **required**
 *     ({@link requiredMovesAt}) — the screen marks them with an arrow and says
 *     so, and the module refuses the others (not a failure: they are the
 *     repertoire's moves, just finished ones);
 *   - when a line ends, play goes back to the deepest position on the way that
 *     still has an uncovered line under it ({@link backtrackTarget}).
 *
 * Coverage is keyed by leaf id — the repertoire's own ids, which the session
 * tree keeps (`addMove` only mints ids for new moves), so a leaf reached in the
 * session is a leaf of the original.
