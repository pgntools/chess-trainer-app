/**
 * The **variation tree**: a game where more than one move can follow a
 * position.
 *
 * `Game` in {@link ./gameModel} is one line of play — a move array. That is the
 * right shape for a game read out of a PGN or grown against the engine, and both
 * shipped screens keep reading it. It cannot express what an analysis board is
 * for: stepping back to move 8 and playing something else has to *keep* both
 * continuations, which is a tree.
 *
 * So this module holds the tree, and a `Game` becomes a **walk over one** —
 * {@link mainlineGame} is the first-child walk, and it is what lets the shared
 * move list, the ply navigation and the board controls keep working against a
 * tree-shaped game with no branching of their own. The two directions are both
 * available: {@link treeFromGame} lifts a linear game into a tree,
 * {@link mainlineGame} flattens one back.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * The tree is plain data and every node carries the FEN of the position *after*
 * its move, exactly as `GameMove` does — so jumping to a node is reading a
 * string, and nothing re-simulates a game. `moves` is the list of alternatives
 * at the very first half-move, and `moves[0]` is the mainline the way
 * `children[0]` is at every deeper level: **the first child is the mainline, the
 * rest are variations.**
 *
 * ## Identity
 *
 * Nodes carry an `id` minted from the tree's own counter rather than derived
 * from their position, because the screen's "where am I" state is a node id and
 * it has to survive moves being added elsewhere in the tree. Ids are stable for
 * the life of a tree and every operation here returns a new tree rather than
 * mutating one, so React state can hold one directly.
