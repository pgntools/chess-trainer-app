/**
 * **Playing a repertoire against a trainer** (CTA-63) — the trainer's policy
 * and the session model, as pure functions over {@link GameTree}s. No React,
 * no `chess.js`: the board core plays the move a policy picks
 * (`views/board/core/useTrainerModule.ts`), and nothing here moves anything.
 *
 * ## The trainer answers from the repertoire, and only from it
 *
 * The trainer is a scripted opponent: at a position where it is its turn, it
 * plays one of the moves the **repertoire** has there — never one the reader
 * added this session, never an engine move. So a policy is always asked about
 * the *original* tree, the record as it was read, not the session's tree that
 * has the reader's extensions hung on it. A node the reader added is not in
 * the original tree at all, so the question "what does the repertoire have
 * here" answers *nothing* for it by construction — which is the whole of why
 * the trainer never moves inside an extension, with no flag to keep in sync.
 *
 * ## A policy is a function, not a mode
 *
 * {@link TrainerPolicy} is the seam every later trainer goes through: a
 * weighted pick (as {@link playChancePolicy} is), mainline-first, spaced
 * repetition. Each is a new function of
 * this one type, handed to the module in place of {@link pickTrainerMove} —
 * never a branch inside it. The random source is a parameter for the same
 * reason the policy is: a test fixes it, and a later policy may not use one.
 *
 * ## An extension is a node the original tree does not hold
 *
 * Node ids are stable for the life of a tree and `addMove` mints each new node
 * a fresh one (`lib/gameTree.ts`), so "was this move added this session" is
 * one set lookup against the ids the repertoire arrived with —
 * {@link extensionIdsOf}. A fold over the tree, recomputed from values; there
 * is no second record of "what the reader added" to be maintained through
 * every move, and so nothing that can drift from the tree. Everything played
 * under an added node is itself added, so it is an extension too.
 *
 * ## Game mode: a move is judged before it is made
 *
 * With game mode on, a reader's move at one of *their* turns inside the
 * repertoire is marked right or wrong **before** it reaches the board
 * ({@link judgeDrop}): a move the repertoire has is a success, any other legal
 * move is a failure, and the module takes a failure back by refusing the drop.
 * So a wrong move never enters the tree and never becomes an extension. It is
 * judged by the squares the piece moves from and to (every node carries them),
 * with `chess.js` used only to *read* whether the drop is legal: an illegal drop
 * snaps back and is not a failure. What a verdict is worth is the screen's
 * business ({@link DrillScore}).
 *
 * What this module deliberately does not do: write anything back to the stored
 * repertoire (the screen never modifies the record).
