/**
 * One option the running worker declared during the `uci` handshake.
 *
 * Read, never assumed. Which options exist — and which of them will take a
 * value — is a property of the *binary* in `public/stockfish/`, not of the UCI
 * spec. Asked `uci`, the build shipped here answers with, among others:
 *
 * ```
 * option name Threads type spin default 1 min 1 max 1
 * option name Hash type spin default 16 min 16 max 16
 * option name MultiPV type spin default 1 min 1 max 500
 * option name Skill Level type spin default 20 min 0 max 20
 * ```
 *
 * So `Threads` and `Hash` are declared but **pinned** — `min` equals `max`, one
 * legal value each — while `MultiPV` and `Skill Level` are genuinely
 * adjustable, and there is no `UCI_Elo` or `UCI_LimitStrength` at all. Three
 * states, not two. A settings UI that hardcoded the usual list would show knobs
 * that silently do nothing, so it reads {@link Engine.options} instead and can
 * say honestly which ones this engine does not have and which ones it has
 * already made up its mind about. {@link Engine.setOption} enforces the same
 * distinction on the wire — see {@link Engine.isSettable}, where the pinned case
 * turns out not to be mere tidiness.
