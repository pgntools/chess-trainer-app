/**
 * **The engine knobs an analysis is worked under** — the value the Analysis
 * Board's Engine tab drives, and the value a saved analysis carries so reopening
 * one puts the engine back the way it was.
 *
 * It lived in `views/tools/analysis/useAnalysisBoard.ts` until a saved analysis
 * had to record it, and then moved here for the reason
 * [`engineSettings.ts`](./engineSettings.ts) exists: `lib/savedAnalyses.ts` is
 * plain data and cannot import a hook. Since the v2 Analysis Board (CTA-73)
 * every consumer — `AnalysisSettings.tsx` included — imports them from here.
 *
 * As there, it is **not** a description of the running engine. Which knobs the
 * worker actually has is `Engine.options`' business
 * (`.claude/rules/chessboard.md` §4.1), so a stored value is a *request* that
 * the hook clamps to whatever the running build declared.
