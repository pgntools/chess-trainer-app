/**
 * **Taking games out of the app** — several PGN records joined into one file,
 * and that file handed to the browser to save.
 *
 * The two halves are here together because they are one feature and neither is
 * large, but they are not the same kind of thing and the split is worth seeing:
 * {@link pgnFileOf} is pure text and knows nothing about a browser;
 * {@link downloadTextFile} is the DOM, and is the only part that cannot run
 * anywhere else. The same line every store draws — `src/lib/` is free of
 * React, not of the platform.
 *
 * ## Why a join rather than a re-write
 *
 * A played game and a saved analysis are already stored *as PGN* — that is the
 * whole point of the storage format (`lib/playedGames.ts`, `lib/savedAnalyses.ts`). So exporting is
 * concatenation, not serialisation: nothing is re-parsed, nothing can be lost in
 * a second pass through the writer, and a record this build cannot read still
 * exports byte for byte. The separator is one blank line, which is what the PGN
 * export format uses between games and what `splitPgnGames` (`lib/pgn.ts`) reads
 * back — so a file written here loads into this app's own Library (as a
 * collection) and Analysis Board, and into anything else that reads PGN.
