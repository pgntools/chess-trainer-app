/**
 * **A saved repertoire's settings** — what the reader can say about a
 * repertoire beyond its text: a description, the side it is played from,
 * whether its board draws the next-move arrows (and colours them by play
 * chance where a branch is marked), and whether it is protected from being
 * changed.
 *
 * One object on the record (`SavedRepertoire.settings`), read back through
 * {@link repertoireSettingsFrom}, which fills **each field on its own** from
 * {@link DEFAULT_REPERTOIRE_SETTINGS}. That is what makes the object
 * extendable without a version bump: a record written before an option
 * existed reads as that option's default, and a record with one unreadable
 * field keeps the others.
 *
 * ## Adding an option
 *
 * 1. A field on {@link RepertoireSettings}, with its doc comment.
 * 2. Its default in {@link DEFAULT_REPERTOIRE_SETTINGS}.
 * 3. One line in {@link repertoireSettingsFrom} — how an untrusted stored
 *    value becomes a usable one.
 * 4. A control in a section of the settings screen
 *    (`views/repertoires/RepertoireSettingsSections.tsx`), or a new section.
 * 5. Its labels in `en.ts` and `he.ts`, under `repertoires.settings`.
 *
 * Nothing else: the store's idempotent compare ({@link sameRepertoireSettings})
 * walks the defaults' keys, so a new field is compared without being named
 * there, and the settings screen edits the whole object as one draft.
 *
 * The title is **not** here: it is the record's `name`, which the list, the
 * board and the tags-derived default already speak. The settings screen edits
 * it beside these.
