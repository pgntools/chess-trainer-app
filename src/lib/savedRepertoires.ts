/**
 * **The reader's own repertoires** — what one is when it is written down, how
 * a text is read on the way in, and the two ways a text of many games becomes
 * repertoires (CTA-61).
 *
 * The three-way split every record in `src/lib/` has: the pure model here, the
 * IndexedDB half in [`savedRepertoireStore.ts`](./savedRepertoireStore.ts),
 * the `useSyncExternalStore` binding in `views/repertoires/useSavedRepertoires.ts`.
 *
 * ## A repertoire is one game
 *
 * **One mainline, with its side lines branching off it** — the shape a
 * repertoire has on lichess or in a book, and the one the board reads. A file
 * of *many* games is not a repertoire in that sense, however it is labelled: a
 * Chessable-style export writes each line as a game of its own (the shipped
 * 2.c3 sampler: 14 games in `"N) "` chapters, none of them with a side line), and
 * a lichess study writes each chapter as one. Such a text is **not stored as
 * it is.** {@link readRepertoireText} reads it into its games, and the reader
 * picks one of two operations:
 *
 * - **Merge** ({@link mergedRepertoireOf}) — every game folded into one tree
 *   (`mergeTrees`): the first game's line is the mainline, and where a later
 *   game leaves it, that becomes a side line. Offered only when every game
 *   starts from the same position, since a tree has one start. The files'
 *   annotations come along (CTA-69) — `{ comments }`, NAGs and `!?` marks,
 *   one text said twice about the same move kept once; each later game's
 *   opening comment opens its own line (`mergeTrees`).
 * - **Split** ({@link splitRepertoiresOf}) — every game its own repertoire,
 *   named by the game (`"2...Qa5 · #1"`) and filed together in a folder named
 *   after the text, each keeping its original text, comments and all.
 *
 * A text of **one** game needs neither and is stored as written. A game with
 * no moves — an introduction chapter that is all prose — is skipped by both,
 * and counted, so the screen can say so.
 *
 * ## A file and a paste are the same record
 *
 * The text is normalised first (line endings, surrounding whitespace) —
 * a `<textarea>` turns `\r\n` into `\n` and a file does not — and a record is
 * built from the text and the reader's name alone, never from a file name,
 * which a paste does not have. `savedRepertoires.test.ts` and
 * `RepertoireUpload.test.tsx` assert the two routes agree.
 *
 * ## What the record carries beside the PGN
 *
 * Read once, when it is brought in, so a list never parses a tree to draw a
 * card: {@link SavedRepertoire.previewFen}, the position where it first
 * branches, and {@link SavedRepertoire.stats}, its size. Plus the reader's
 * {@link SavedRepertoire.settings} and the `folderId` it is filed under.
