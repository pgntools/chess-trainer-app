/**
 * A dependency-free port of the read side of `react-tree-manager`'s
 * `TreeManager` (the 0.13 contract — see github.com/pgntools/react-tree-manager).
 *
 * The published package is a single rolled-up bundle that inlines a whole copy
 * of MUI, emotion and xstate for its `TreeViewer` component, so pulling it in
 * costs ~37 KB gzip for a class this app only reads a few methods of. The class
 * is carried here instead.
 *
 * **This file is the seam.** Nothing else builds a tree walk by hand — the
 * sidebar goes through `src/views/main/navTree.ts`, which is the only consumer.
 * If the app ever needs the parts left out here (`add` / `delete` / `move`, or
 * the `TreeViewer` component), swap this file's internals for the real
 * dependency and keep the exports.
