/**
 * **The reader's games on Play with Engine v2** (CTA-74) — what one is when it
 * is written down, and how it is read back.
 *
 * The saved games' three-way split again (pure model here, `localStorage` in
 * [`playedGameStore.ts`](./playedGameStore.ts), a `useSyncExternalStore`
 * binding in `views/engine/games/usePlayedGames.ts`) — a **new** store beside
 * [`savedGames.ts`](./savedGames.ts) rather than a new version of it, because
 * the game is a different shape now and the old records are not migrated.
 * Only what is different is written out here:
 *
 * - **A tree, not a line.** A move played by hand from an earlier position is
 *   a side line under it, so the record is `treeToPgn` out and
 *   `parsePgnTree` back — the saved analyses' pair, not `gameToPgn`.
 * - **Where the reader stands is part of it**, as SAN from the start
 *   (`sanPathTo` / `nodeAtSanPath`) — a node id would not survive the PGN
 *   round trip. The reader's **side** is `settings.playAs`, the way the old
 *   record carried it: the board faces it and the engine plays the other.
 * - **The evals are keyed by FEN**, not by ply: a ply cannot say which line
 *   it is on. Only positions the tree reaches are kept.
 * - **Flat.** No folders — the list is newest first and nothing else.
