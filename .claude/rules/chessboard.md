# Chessboard rules & patterns

How **this project** builds and operates chess boards, and the index to
everything else. Read this before adding a new board screen or customizing an
existing one.

- **UI library:** [`react-chessboard`](https://react-chessboard.vercel.app/?path=/docs/get-started--docs) **v5** (`^5.12.1`)
- **Rules engine:** [`chess.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js) **v1** (`^1.4.0`)
- **Analysis engine:** Stockfish WASM worker, wrapped by [`src/lib/engine.ts`](../../src/lib/engine.ts)
- **React 19** is required by react-chessboard v5.

## 0. Where to look

Everything about the library is already on disk. **Do not read `node_modules`
source and do not web-search for react-chessboard questions** — answer from
these instead.

**Loaded every session** (no need to open anything — it is already in context):

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| **this file** | project conventions, the engine wrapper and its protocol discipline, the board screens, v4→v5, testing a board |
| [`react-chessboard-options-api.md`](./react-chessboard-options-api.md) | **every `options.*` key** — type, default, purpose. All 43 of them. |
| [`react-chessboard-types-and-helpers.md`](./react-chessboard-types-and-helpers.md) | exported helpers (`generateBoard`, `fenStringToPositionObject`, `chessColumnToColumnIndex`, `getRelativeCoords`, …) and every handler-arg / data type (`PieceDropHandlerArgs`, `SquareHandlerArgs`, `PieceRenderObject`, `FenPieceString`, …) |

**Also on disk, and the one to read before building a *new* board screen** —
[`chessboard-v2.md`](./chessboard-v2.md) (CTA-60): the **unified board core**
the `/dev/*` Development screens are composed from. A base hook, optional
capability modules (engine, opening book, persistence), and one slotted
shell/panel layer, plus a derivation table for the five boards and a recipe for
adding a sixth. Nothing there overrides this file — it says who *owns* which of
these rules once five screens share one implementation. The Analysis Board of
§5 below is built on it since CTA-73 (Analysis v2, shipped); the other shipped
board screens of §5 are untouched by it and stay the reference.

**And, for how such a board shows its game tree** —
[`tree-views.md`](./tree-views.md) (CTA-72): the move list, map, comments
and next-move arrows as a pluggable **tree view** out of
`src/views/explorer/` — one seam (`TreeViewSource` in, `TreeViewParts` out),
the rich variations explorer built (the repertoire player's), the flat and
puzzle modes specified.

**On disk, read on demand** — [`docs/vendor/react-chessboard/`](../../docs/vendor/react-chessboard/),
routed by its [`INDEX.md`](../../docs/vendor/react-chessboard/INDEX.md):

| Need | Open |
| --- | --- |
| A worked, compiling example of one option | `stories/options/<OptionName>.stories.tsx` |
| A full feature pattern (promotion picker, premoves, puzzles, multiplayer, 3D) | `stories/advanced-examples/` |
| The core interaction patterns (click-to-move, spare pieces, play-vs-random) | `stories/basic-examples/` |
| Narrative walkthroughs of the above | `B_BasicExamples.mdx`, `C_AdvancedExamples.mdx` |
| The full v4→v5 migration detail (§6 here is the summary) | `G_UpgradeToV5.mdx` |

On conflict **this file wins** — the two vendored rules files are upstream
reference and say nothing about how we wire things up.

---

## 1. Core principle: the board is pure UI

`react-chessboard` renders pieces on squares and reports pointer events. It has
**no concept of chess rules, turns, legality, check, or game over.** All of that
is `chess.js`. Keep the two cleanly separated:

```
chess.js (rules + state)  ->  FEN string  ->  <Chessboard options={{ position }} />
        ^                                              |
        |________________ onPieceDrop / onSquareClick __|
```

---

## 2. Creating a board

```tsx
import { Chessboard, type ChessboardOptions } from 'react-chessboard';

function MyBoard() {
  const chessboardOptions: ChessboardOptions = {
    id: 'my-board',
  };
  return <Chessboard options={chessboardOptions} />;
}
```

Rules:

- **Always pass a single `options` object typed as `ChessboardOptions`.** This
  catches misspelled / removed keys at compile time. Do not spread untyped
  literals.
- **Always set `options.id`** to a stable, unique string. The default is
  `"chessboard"`; two boards sharing an id on one page will conflict. The id is
  also the DOM id and is used by drag sensors.
- **No `boardWidth` prop in v5.** The board is fully responsive and fills its
  parent. Size it by constraining the container (the app already does this in
  `views/main/Layout.tsx` via `layout-board-square-body`). For a standalone
  board wrap it in a `max-width` box.
- **`ChessboardProvider`** is only needed for spare pieces / drag-from-palette
  setups or when you need `useChessboardContext`. Plain boards just use
  `<Chessboard>`. When you do need it, **every option moves to it** and
  `<Chessboard />` takes none — `views/tools/editor/BoardEditor.tsx` is the
  in-repo example, and §5 has the rest of what that changes. It renders no
  element of its own, so it costs the layout nothing.
- **The board must never mirror.** `Layout.tsx` wraps the board area in
  `ForceLTR` — files run a–h left to right in every language. See the root
  `CLAUDE.md` for why.

### Minimal state pattern (use this for any interactive board)

```tsx
// 1. chess.js in a REF, not state: handlers must see the latest game without
//    stale closures, and mutating it should not by itself trigger a render.
const chessGameRef = useRef(new Chess());
const chessGame = chessGameRef.current;

// 2. Mirror the position into state as a FEN string. Passing it back through
//    options.position makes <Chessboard> controlled — setting the string is
//    what re-renders the board.
const [chessPosition, setChessPosition] = useState(chessGame.fen());
```

To reset / load a position, replace the ref (`chessGameRef.current = new
Chess(fen)`) and then `setChessPosition(...)`.

---

## 3. Operations

> Option types, defaults and per-option examples are in
> [`react-chessboard-options-api.md`](./react-chessboard-options-api.md).
> This section is only the **project-specific** wiring around them.

### 3.1 Move by drag — `onPieceDrop`

```tsx
import type { PieceDropHandlerArgs } from 'react-chessboard';

function onPieceDrop({ sourceSquare, targetSquare, piece }: PieceDropHandlerArgs) {
  if (!targetSquare) return false; // dropped off the board

  try {
    chessGame.move({ from: sourceSquare, to: targetSquare, promotion: 'q' });
  } catch {
    return false; // chess.js throws on an illegal move -> snap back
  }

  setChessPosition(chessGame.fen());
  return true; // accept the move
}
```

- **Return value matters.** `true` = accept (board keeps the move), `false` =
  reject (board snaps the piece back). Return `true` for every move you actually
  applied — including the move that ends the game. Returning `false` after a
  successful `chess.js` move is a bug (it desyncs the board's internal drag
  state from the position).
- `targetSquare` is `null` when dropped outside the board — handle it first.
- `chess.js` `.move()` **throws** on illegal moves in v1; wrap in `try/catch`.
- `.move()` accepts `{ from: string; to: string; promotion?: string }` — plain
  strings, no cast needed.

### 3.2 Move by click — `onSquareClick`

Set `allowDragging: false` and drive a small "from / to" state machine.

```tsx
const [moveFrom, setMoveFrom] = useState('');
const [optionSquares, setOptionSquares] = useState<Record<string, React.CSSProperties>>({});

// options: { allowDragging: false, onSquareClick, squareStyles: optionSquares, position, id }
```

First click on an own piece: compute legal targets with
`chessGame.moves({ square, verbose: true })` and paint them via `squareStyles`.
Second click: if it matches a legal target, `chessGame.move(...)`; otherwise
treat it as selecting a new piece. Clear `moveFrom` + `optionSquares` after a
move.

`moves({ square })` types `square` as `chess.js` `Square` — cast with
`square as Square` when calling it.

Full worked example: `stories/basic-examples/ClickToMove.stories.tsx`.

### 3.3 Highlighting squares — `squareStyles`

Keyed by square id (`"e4"`), layered on top of the light/dark square styles.
Use it for legal-move dots, last-move highlight, selected square, check
indicator, right-click marks. The legal-move dot idiom used across the screens:

```tsx
newSquares[move.to] = {
  background: 'radial-gradient(circle, rgba(0,0,0,.1) 25%, transparent 25%)',
  borderRadius: '50%',
};
```

### 3.4 Arrows

Arrows **you pass in** via `options.arrows` are external / controlled: they are
NOT auto-cleared on click or position change. Recompute the array yourself when
the position changes — see the Openings screen's book-continuation arrows.
User-drawn (right-drag) arrows are separate and follow `clearArrowsOnClick` /
`clearArrowsOnPositionChange`. (The last move is not an arrow any more — CTA-48
replaced it with a lichess-style highlight through `options.squareStyles`, built
by `squareStylesAtPly` in `lib/gameNavigation.ts`, which obeys the same
external-styles discipline: the board never clears them, so each ply hands it
the whole set.)

### 3.5 Promotion

**v5 removed all built-in promotion UI** (`onPromotionPieceSelect`,
`showPromotionDialog`, `autoPromoteToQueen`, …). You must handle it yourself:

1. In `onPieceDrop`, detect a pawn reaching the last rank
   (`targetSquare` ends in `8` or `1`) and that the move is legal
   (`chessGame.moves({ square: sourceSquare })` contains `` `${targetSquare}=` ``).
2. Stash `{ sourceSquare, targetSquare }` in state and render your own
   piece picker (`defaultPieces` from `react-chessboard` gives you the SVGs;
   `chessColumnToColumnIndex` helps position it over the file).
3. On pick, `chessGame.move({ from, to, promotion })` and clear the stash.

The demos currently hardcode `promotion: 'q'` for simplicity — that is a
**demo-only shortcut**, not the pattern for the real app. Worked example:
`stories/advanced-examples/PiecePromotion.stories.tsx`.

---

## 4. Stockfish engine integration

Wrapper: [`src/lib/engine.ts`](../../src/lib/engine.ts). Worker script + wasm
live in `public/stockfish/`, served under Vite's `base` — so the worker URL is
built from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, never hardcoded to the site root. The app
deploys to GitHub Pages at `/chess-trainer-app/`, where a bare
`/stockfish/stockfish.wasm.js` 404s; `new Worker()` reports that as an async
`error` event rather than throwing, so the board simply never evaluates.

### API

| Method | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `new Engine()` | Spawns a **dedicated Worker**. One per mounted board. |
| `search(fen, { depth = 12, movetime })` | The one to use. Depth is clamped to 24; `movetime` is milliseconds and is omitted when 0. **May not start immediately** — see §4.1. |
| `evaluatePosition(fen, depth = 12)` | Thin alias for `search(fen, { depth })`. No current caller — the demo boards that used it were removed; kept as a convenience wrapper. |
| `onMessage(cb) => unsubscribe` | Parsed UCI messages. **Returns an unsubscribe fn — you must call it.** |
| `setOption(name, value) => boolean` | Buffered, not posted (§4.1). `false` means this build will not take it — either it has no such option or it has pinned it. |
| `whenOptionsReady(cb) => unsubscribe` | Runs `cb` once `options` is complete, immediately if the handshake already landed. |
| `options` / `supportsOption(name)` | What the **running worker** declared, from its own `uci` reply. |
| `stop()` | `stop` — engine returns bestmove for the depth reached so far. |
| `terminate()` | `quit` + `worker.terminate()`. Call on unmount. |

Parsed message shape (`EngineMessage`): `bestMove` (`"e2e4"` or `"e7e8q"` with
promotion), `ponder`, `positionEvaluation` (centipawns, **string**),
`possibleMate`, `pv` (best line, space-separated moves), `depth` (number),
`multipv` (1-based line rank), and `fen` — **the position this result is for**.

`fen` has no UCI equivalent; the wrapper stamps it on. Without it you cannot tell
a result for the position on screen from one still draining out of the search it
replaced, which is how a screen ends up playing a move computed for a position
the player has navigated away from.

### 4.1 The protocol discipline — why `search` and `setOption` are deferred

**The build in `public/stockfish/` abandons a running search if it receives a
`setoption` while searching.** Not an error, not an ignored command: no
`bestmove`, no further `info`, and the board never evaluates again. It is silent,
so it does not look like a protocol bug — it looks like a broken worker.

`Engine` therefore buffers everything and posts it only when the engine can take
it. Nothing goes out before `uciok` (until the engine lists its options there is
no way to tell a real one from a name this build has never heard of), and nothing
goes out while a search is running (a `stop` goes instead, and the `bestmove`
that ends the search resumes the queue). Options are applied to an idle engine,
and a waiting search starts only afterwards — so a search always runs under the
settings that were asked for.

Consequences for a caller:

- **Call `search()` whenever the position changes; do not sequence it yourself.**
  A second call before the first has started replaces it, so rapid stepping
  through a game does not build a queue of searches nobody is looking at.
- **A pinned option is never sent.** An option whose `min` equals its `max` has
  one legal value, so posting it can only be a no-op — except that
  `setoption name Threads value 1`, this build's *own declared default*, is
  itself fatal to it. `setOption` returns `false` for those.
- **Never hardcode the option roster.** `Threads` and `Hash` exist here but are
  pinned (`min 1 max 1`, `min 16 max 16`); there is no `UCI_Elo` and no
  `UCI_LimitStrength`, so strength is `Skill Level` only and any Elo figure shown
  is an estimate, never a setting. Read `engine.options` and render three states:
  absent, pinned, and adjustable. `views/engine/play/EngineSettings.tsx` is the
  worked example, and doing it this way means swapping the binary changes the UI
  with no code change.

### Rules for using it from React

1. **Create the engine lazily in a ref, resolved at call time — never during
   render**, not `useMemo`, not module scope:

   ```tsx
   const engineRef = useRef<Engine | null>(null);
   const getEngine = useCallback(() => (engineRef.current ??= new Engine()), []);
   ```

   Module-scope workers leak across route changes and can never be torn down.
   Reading the engine during render (`const engine = engineRef.current`) looks
   equivalent but dies under StrictMode: its mount → unmount → remount runs the
   cleanups and then the effects again **with no render in between**, so every
   effect keeps the instance that rule 3 just terminated and the board is silent
   for the rest of the session. `getEngine()` rebuilds it instead. Call it from
   the effects and the move handlers; the engine is then absent from their
   dependency arrays.

2. **Subscribe in an effect, unsubscribe on cleanup.** Never call
   `engine.onMessage(...)` inside a per-move function — that adds a new listener
   every move and never removes it.

   Declare this effect **first**, so on a StrictMode remount it is the one that
   rebuilds the worker before the evaluate effect asks it for a search.

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const unsubscribe = getEngine().onMessage((msg) => { /* setState */ });
     return unsubscribe;
   }, [getEngine, chessGame]);
   ```

3. **Terminate on unmount** (also covers StrictMode's mount→unmount→remount):

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => () => { engineRef.current?.terminate(); engineRef.current = null; }, []);
   ```

4. **Normalize the score — through `lib/engineAnalysis.ts`, not by hand.**
   Stockfish reports `cp` / `mate` from the **side-to-move's** perspective, so
   the same number means White on one turn and Black on the next. `scoreFromUci`
   is the single place that flip happens; `formatScore` and `evalBarFraction`
   then assume White's perspective, and a mate prints as `M5`, never as the
   five-figure centipawn number it would otherwise imply.

   Pass the turn of **the position that was searched** (read it off that FEN),
   not `chessGame.turn()` — on a screen where the board can show an earlier ply
   those are different, and mixing them inverts every evaluation shown.

5. **Filter shallow updates.** The engine streams partial results while it
   searches; ignore messages below a threshold depth (~10) to reduce churn.

6. On a new user move: `engine.stop()`, clear stale `pv` / mate state, update
   the position; let the "evaluate on position change" effect start the next
   search.

## 5. The board screens

| Route | File | Based on upstream story | Demonstrates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | [`views/home/Home.tsx`](../../src/views/home/Home.tsx) | — | Landing page, no board — a card per screen, built from `navTree()` |
| `/engine/play` | [`views/engine/play/PlayWithEngine.tsx`](../../src/views/engine/play/PlayWithEngine.tsx) | (composed) | **A v2 screen since CTA-74** — the Analysis Board's composition (`usePlayGame`: the core, the engine module, the shared Play toggle `usePlayToggle`, the variations explorer) with **Play on from the start**: the engine plays the side not at the bottom, paused by a step back or a change of side (the flip, or the header's White / Black toggle). The header also carries **Replay** (start over, the saved progress discarded) and **Resign** (the reader's side loses; the board then takes no more moves), both asked first. A game is a **tree** — a move by hand from an earlier position is a side line. Tabs Moves · Map · Engine (the shipped `EngineSettings`, without *Play as* and New game). **Autosaved** on every move to `lib/playedGameStore.ts` (the URL becomes `?saved=<id>`); takes `?fen=` and `?saved=`. `options.id` is `play-with-engine` |
| `/engine/games` | [`views/engine/games/PlayedGames.tsx`](../../src/views/engine/games/PlayedGames.tsx) | (composed) | Saved games (CTA-74): the games above, flat and newest first, each titled by its pairing ("Human - Stockfish level 10") with its PGN result — Continue (`?saved=<id>`), Analysis (`?game=play/games/<id>`), delete (asked first). No board. (The pre-CTA-74 `/engine/saved` list and its folders were deleted.) |
| `/masked/play` | [`views/masked/play/MaskedPlay.tsx`](../../src/views/masked/play/MaskedPlay.tsx) | `Pieces` | The same screen with the pieces in disguise: `options.pieces` built from a `PieceMask` (`lib/pieceMask.ts`), and the notation masked to match. `usePlayWithEngine` reused verbatim |
| `/tools/analysis` | [`views/tools/analysis/AnalysisBoard.tsx`](../../src/views/tools/analysis/AnalysisBoard.tsx) | (composed) | **A v2 screen since CTA-73** — the core, the engine module (its best move played for the opponent's side only while the header's **Play** toggle is on — disabled while the engine is off, paused by a step back) and the shared **variations explorer** ([`tree-views.md`](./tree-views.md); editing on, *Play chances…* off): a **variation tree** (`lib/gameTree.ts`), both colours movable from any node, the engine and the eval bar switched independently. Tabs Moves · Map · Load · Export · Engine: Load takes a PGN (one game; several merged onto the board or split into a folder of saved analyses) or a FEN, Export copies the FEN and copies or downloads the PGN with or without comments, NAGs and side lines. **Saved explicitly** — the header's Save opens the changes strip (Update / Save as copy / Discard) over a record, or a name-and-folder dialog for a new board. Takes `?fen=`, `?game=`+`?move=`, `?analysis=` and writes `?at=` back. `options.id` is `analysis` |
| `/tools/analysis/saved` | [`views/tools/analysis/saved/SavedAnalyses.tsx`](../../src/views/tools/analysis/saved/SavedAnalyses.tsx) | (composed) | The analyses saved above, kept in `localStorage`, newest first, filed into a nested tree of folders (CTA-73; `?folder=<id>`) — as rows, or as read-only preview boards at either card size, each showing the position and the side the reader **was standing on**. Each links to its settings screen (`/tools/analysis/saved/<id>/settings`: title, description, side, next-move arrows, folder) and is filed from its row or card; folders are created, renamed, moved (never into their own subtree), deleted keeping their contents and downloaded as one `.pgn`. Laid out as the Repertoires list without its Games menu: an Open button (on a card, the board), the settings gear and a checkbox on every row and card, deleting in bulk; `?analysis=<id>` is the one destination (the `?game=analysis/saved/<id>` reference still resolves). See the root `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/openings` | [`views/tools/openings/OpeningsBoard.tsx`](../../src/views/tools/openings/OpeningsBoard.tsx) | (composed) | Opening exploration: a regular board the reader plays through, the book continuations from the position on screen listed explorer-style, and the Analysis Board's variation tree behind it all. Takes `?fen=` (the arrival the three board screens share) and `?openings=<id>` (a saved opening to go on exploring); hands Play with Engine `?fen=` from the position on screen |
| `/openings/saved` | [`views/tools/openings/saved/SavedOpenings.tsx`](../../src/views/tools/openings/saved/SavedOpenings.tsx) | (composed) | The openings saved from the screen above, newest first, filed into a tree of folders — as rows, or as read-only preview boards at either card size, each showing the end of the mainline. Drilling in, a breadcrumb back up, and folder CRUD; the view toggle, the export bar and the delete control are the shared saved-list machinery (`views/shared/savedList.ts`). `?openings=<id>` reopens one there; `?fen=` hands Play with Engine the end of the mainline. The Saved analyses screen over the same view machinery — see the root `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/library` · `/library/<collection>` · `/library/new` | [`views/library/LibraryHome.tsx`](../../src/views/library/LibraryHome.tsx), [`CollectionScreen.tsx`](../../src/views/library/CollectionScreen.tsx), [`LibraryUpload.tsx`](../../src/views/library/LibraryUpload.tsx) | (composed) | **The Library** (CTA-75) — no board: the collections (the shipped ones wired by `node scripts/wirepgn.js` and listed off `src/data/library/manifest.json` with no fetch, then the reader's uploads in IndexedDB), a collection's games as a **sortable, filterable table** read off its **index** (`lib/collectionIndex.ts` — built once: tags plus a `chess.js` pass, an unreadable game marked; MUI `Table` with `TableSortLabel`, a words box, and a right-hand panel of filters — player and side, opening or ECO, event, a date range, result — each shown only where the games carry that field; a checkbox per row and the saved lists' export bar, whose select-all takes every filtered row on every page and downloads them as one `.pgn`; paged; the state in the URL), and a `.pgn` file or a paste checked game by game in a Web Worker, under a progress bar, before it becomes a new collection. Sized for 5,000–10,000 games. See the root `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/library/<collection>/<game>` | [`views/library/LibraryGameBoard.tsx`](../../src/views/library/LibraryGameBoard.tsx), behind [`LibraryGameScreen.tsx`](../../src/views/library/LibraryGameScreen.tsx) | (composed) | **A v2 screen from the start** (CTA-75) — a collection's game (its 1-based number) on a full analysis board: the Analysis Board's session (`useAnalysisSession`: core, engine, Play) and the variations explorer, tabs Moves · Map · Info · Export · Engine, previous / next game in the header. **Saved explicitly**: an uploaded collection's game is updated in place or copied right after itself; a shipped one is read-only, and its copy goes to Saved analyses. Writes `?at=` back. `options.id` is `library-game` |
| `/tools/editor` | [`views/tools/editor/BoardEditor.tsx`](../../src/views/tools/editor/BoardEditor.tsx) | `SparePieces` | Position editing: `ChessboardProvider` + spare-piece palettes, `{ skipValidation: true }`, illegal positions reported rather than refused, hand-off to either of the two screens above. Takes a `?fen=` starting position, and offers a reset back to it |
| `/repertoires/<id>` | [`views/repertoires/RepertoireBoard.tsx`](../../src/views/repertoires/RepertoireBoard.tsx) | (composed) | **The first shipped board built from the v2 core** — since CTA-63 the **player** ([`RepertoirePlayer.tsx`](../../src/views/repertoires/RepertoirePlayer.tsx), behind this route file) ([`chessboard-v2.md`](./chessboard-v2.md)) — one of the reader's own repertoires (CTA-61) — **one game**, a mainline with its side lines (Moves · Engine; a text of several games is merged into one tree or split into many on the way in). Its tree is parsed behind a `setTimeout(0)`, because the 7,859-node one-tree example takes about a second. `/repertoires` lists them over the saved-list machinery (preview board `repertoires-preview-<id>`), filed into one level of folders (`?folder=<id>`; a split lands in a folder of its own; a repertoire moves between them from its settings, and the list deletes in bulk over checkboxes on every row and card — CTA-68); `/repertoires/new` brings one in from a file or a paste; `/repertoires/<id>/settings` edits its title, description and main color — the board opens facing that color (`useBoardCore`'s `orientation`, read once), and so does the preview card |
| `/repertoires/<id>` (the player) and `/repertoires/<id>/games/<game>` | [`views/repertoires/RepertoirePlayer.tsx`](../../src/views/repertoires/RepertoirePlayer.tsx), behind [`RepertoireBoard.tsx`](../../src/views/repertoires/RepertoireBoard.tsx) / [`RepertoireGame.tsx`](../../src/views/repertoires/RepertoireGame.tsx) | (composed) | **One screen, a repertoire read, drilled and played** (CTA-63). `useTrainerModule` ([`chessboard-v2.md`](./chessboard-v2.md) §2.5) is the opponent: it answers only from the file, by the lichess-tools **play chances** (`prc:N` in a move's comment, else the move with more lines in the next 8 plies more often — `lib/playChance.ts`; set per branch from the move menu's *Play chances…*, CTA-69), and only after the reader has moved (stepping back never triggers it) — in the player behind **Autoplay** (off by default), always in a game. A move the file does not have is added under the node on screen and tinted in the move list. A header **Play** button toggles Autoplay beside the Settings switch (CTA-65; the player only). Tabs Moves · (Score) · Settings · Engine; the Moves tab is the **variations explorer** (the shared move list with every side line hung under its move), and in the player a right-click on a move opens its menu — promote variation, make main line, delete from here (asking first, with the count of moves and lines), copy variation PGN (CTA-64; pure edits in `lib/gameTree.ts`, applied through the core's `replaceTree`, which keeps the reader where they stand; a game has no menu); Settings holds the side, Autoplay, the arrows (off by default; mainline and side lines in two colours, `nextMoveArrowsOf`) and the engine's switch (off by default — the Engine tab is disabled until then; the engine never moves a piece). The **games** (`lib/repertoireGames.ts`): **Get to the end** and **Backtracking** — the reader's moves judged before they are made (a wrong one taken back, one verdict per position), a Score tab, and for Backtracking the coverage of every line, a required move marked with a purple arrow, a return to the deepest position with a line left, and a **Map** tab — the repertoire as an SVG tree, covered lines and the reader's position on it (`lib/treeMap.ts`, drawn by the shared explorer's `TreeMap.tsx`), zoomed by the wheel and panned by dragging — in the tab and in a full-screen view alike — with each move written above its dot (Show moves, on by default). The player has the Map too, without coverage, drawn from the session's tree so moves the reader adds appear on it as they are played, in the extension colour; there a written move's dot is a link to its position, in the tab and full screen, and a right-click on it opens the same move menu as the Moves tab (CTA-67) — the edit redrawn on the map at once, the view left where it was, the full-screen view left open. Dots are white or black by the side that moved. The player's position travels as `?at=<SANs from the start>` (`lib/repertoireLink.ts`), read on arrival and written back with history replace, so its URL is always a permanent link. No autosave: while the session differs from the record, the header's Save button lights up and opens a strip that offers **Update repertoire** (the record takes the session's tree — unless the repertoire is **protected**, its settings' default, when the strip says so and links to its settings in Update's place), **Save as copy** (a new record, opened at the position on screen, the original untouched) or **Discard**; the header's download writes the tree out; a game never writes. `options.id` is `repertoire-board` (the player) or `repertoire-game` |

The `Main.tsx` file next to each board is a layout-only wrapper (an MUI `Box`
with a `data-testid`); the board component is the unit of interest. Each
"upstream story" column entry names a file in
`docs/vendor/react-chessboard/stories/`.

There used to be four small demo screens under `views/demos/` and
`views/player/` (a bare board, a move loop, an eval demo, a minimal
engine-play), each showing one idea; they were removed and `/` is now the
landing page. The vendored Storybook examples under
`docs/vendor/react-chessboard/stories/` still carry those minimal patterns when
you need the smallest version of one.

**Four rules the pre-v2 Play with Engine screen was built on** (Masked Pieces
still runs its hook, `usePlayWithEngine`; the v2 screen of CTA-74 keeps the
first — it searches the position on screen — and replaces the second: it saves
a tree to its own store, `lib/playedGameStore.ts`, and a move from an earlier
position is a side line rather than refused)**, worth reusing:**

- **Search the position on screen, not the live one.** The player can step back
  at any time. Everything shown — evaluation, variations, depth — describes the
  ply being looked at, so that is what gets searched; the engine's move is played
  only when the search that produced it was for the live position. Dragging is
  disabled off the live position, because a drag there would apply to a position
  nobody is looking at.
- **The game is written down as it is played, and only here.** An effect in
  `usePlayWithEngine` saves the `Game` plus the `EngineSettings` on every move
  (`lib/savedGames.ts`), gated on a `persist` flag this screen passes and Masked
  Pieces does not. Resuming is `?saved=<id>`, seeded as *initial* state exactly
  as `?fen=` is — including the ply, which for a resumed game is the **last**
  one, because that is the live position it can be played on from. See the root
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Anything sharing the board square with the board takes width out of it.** The
  shell hands the screen a square and knows nothing about an eval bar
  (`Layout.tsx` is not changed for one). Bar width + gap must come to exactly the
  constant subtracted from the board's side, and the board box needs
  `flexShrink: 0`, or flex shaves the difference off and the board stops being
  square. That rule now lives in exactly one file —
  [`views/shared/EngineBoardSquare.tsx`](../../src/views/shared/EngineBoardSquare.tsx),
  which both engine-play screens render. **A third screen with an eval bar
  renders that, rather than copying the `calc()`.**
- **The captured-pieces strips are that arithmetic for height.** Two 20px strips
  sit on the board's top and bottom edges, outside it, and the board gives up
  their height — the eval bar's width discipline turned 90°. The strips' height
  + gap must come to exactly the constant the board's side gives up
  (`CAPTURED_STRIPS_TOTAL_PX`), the board box is a `calc` of it off **both**
  width and height — one percentage base, so it stays square — and nothing
  shrinks. The one-strip component and every constant live in
  [`views/shared/CapturedPieces.tsx`](../../src/views/shared/CapturedPieces.tsx);
  `EngineBoardSquare` composes the strips for the two engine screens, and every
  other play/analysis board wraps its own two around its board. **A strip with
  nothing in it still renders** — empty strips hold the board's size steady, so
  a board does not resize when the first capture lands. The Board Editor and
  the preview boards carry none: pieces are put and removed there, never
  captured.

**And three the list screens add:**

- **A read-only board is a board, and it still takes an `options.id` that is
  unique on the page.** A list screen renders one per card, so the id is the
  item's, never a constant — `saved-analyses-preview-<id>`,
  `repertoires-preview-<id>`.
- **A screen that scrolls inside the board square divides that square up
  itself, and a grid of `auto` rows will not scroll.** The shell hands the
  screen a fixed-height box and scrolls nothing in it, so a list screen is a
  flex column — a `flexShrink: 0` top bar over a `flex: 1; minHeight: 0;
  overflowY: auto` region (the Library's table: a `TableContainer` that
  scrolls both ways, a sticky header, the pagination pinned under it). That much is the usual pattern; the trap is the
  next line. An `auto` grid row inside a box whose height is *definite* is
  stretched to share that height out — `alignContent: "start"` does not stop it
  — so the cards were squashed to a quarter of their height, clipped by `Card`'s
  own `overflow: hidden`, and there was never any overflow to scroll.
  **`gridAutoRows: "max-content"` is what makes a row as tall as the card in
  it**, and therefore what makes the region scroll at all. Any board screen that
  grids content inside the square needs the same.
- **A position turns the board; a game does not.** A `?fen=` arrival faces the
  side to move, because that is the side about to answer. A game — a Library
  game, a `?game=` arrival — opens at its start facing White with the flip
  control offered, because a PGN's side to move at ply 0 says nothing about
  which side is being studied. The rule the root `CLAUDE.md` states for the
  board screens.

**And one the Masked Pieces screen adds:**

- **`options.pieces` is the only honest place to disguise a piece.** The mask is
  a map from a true type to the type drawn for it, turned into a renderer per
  type by `maskedPieces` (`lib/pieceMask.ts`), each one taken straight out of the
  library's `defaultPieces` so a masked rook is *pixel-identical* to a real pawn
  rather than merely similar. The board goes on reporting the real source and
  target squares, so `onPieceDrop`, legality and promotion never learn anything
  happened — which is what keeps the screen ordinary chess and lets it reuse
  `usePlayWithEngine` with no edits at all. Never reach for `squareRenderer`,
  a doctored `position`, or anything that would change what `chess.js` is holding.

**And three the Analysis Board adds:**

- **An analysis board moves a piece only when the reader presses Play**
  (CTA-73), and then only **the opponent's**: the reader plays the side at the
  bottom of the board, and `onBestMove` plays a finished search's best move at
  the node on screen only while the header's Play toggle is on (and the engine
  is) and it is the other side to move; off, a `bestmove` is ignored. Any step
  that is not one move forward (back, Home, an earlier move, another line, a
  load) pauses it, and the reader goes on by hand until pressing Play again.
  Play is disabled while the engine is off, and pauses itself when the
  position is over. While Play is on, a status line in the footer
  (`EngineThinking.tsx`) says the engine is thinking — a spinner, moving dots
  and the depth reached — or that it is the reader's move, and a ring spins
  round the Play button while it thinks. The play screen's reply is different in kind — it
  answers the live position, for one side, always — and whether both colours
  are draggable (`canMoveAt`) is the rest of the difference; no mode flag.
- **A screen that can branch navigates by node, not by ply.** See the root
  `CLAUDE.md` on the tree; the shared `BoardControls` still take a ply, and
  `useTreeNavigation` derives one from the line the reader is standing on.
- **The board is written down when the reader says so, and so is where they
  are standing** (CTA-73 — it used to autosave). `useAnalysisBoard` holds the
  saved record and a baseline tree; `tree !== baseline` lights the Save button,
  and Update / Save as copy / a new board's Save write the tree, the settings,
  the orientation and the SAN path to the current node (`lib/savedAnalyses.ts`),
  with the reader's name and folder. Reopening is `?analysis=`. See the root
  `CLAUDE.md`.

**And two the Board Editor adds:**

- **Spare pieces mean `ChessboardProvider`, and the options move with them.**
  Every option that would have gone on `<Chessboard>` goes on the provider
  instead and the board itself takes no props (§2, and
  `stories/basic-examples/SparePieces.stories.tsx`) — a `SparePiece` can only
  reach the drag context from inside it. `onPieceDrop` then does the whole job:
  `piece.isSparePiece` says whether it came from a palette, and a `null`
  `targetSquare` — anywhere off the board, the palettes and the trash included —
  is a deletion. The provider renders no element, so it costs the layout nothing.
- **A board being edited is illegal on the way to being legal.** It is a
  `chess.js` built with `{ skipValidation: true }`, only ever `put` to and
  `remove`d from, and `lib/positionEditor.ts` *reports* what is wrong instead of
  refusing it — see the root `CLAUDE.md`. The one thing `chess.js` still refuses
  is a second king of one colour, so `put` returning `false` is a real branch and
  the drop has to put back whatever it lifted.

## 6. v4 → v5 cheat sheet

If you paste a v4 snippet from the web, translate it:

- Every `customX` prop lost its prefix: `customArrows` → `arrows`,
  `customBoardStyle` → `boardStyle`, `customSquareStyles` → `squareStyles`,
  `customPieces` → `pieces`, `customSquare` → `squareRenderer`, …
- `arePiecesDraggable` → `allowDragging`; `areArrowsAllowed` →
  `allowDrawingArrows`; `allowDragOutsideBoard` → `allowDragOffBoard`;
  `animationDuration` → `animationDurationInMs`; `showBoardNotation` →
  `showNotation`; `isDraggablePiece` → `canDragPiece`.
- `boardWidth` — **removed**, board is responsive (size the container).
- All promotion props (`onPromotionPieceSelect`, `showPromotionDialog`,
  `autoPromoteToQueen`, `promotionToSquare`, …) — **removed**, handle promotion
  externally (§3.5).
- Premove props — **removed**, handle externally
  (`stories/advanced-examples/Premoves.stories.tsx`).
- Props are no longer passed individually — everything goes inside `options`.
- Handler signatures changed to single named-arg objects, e.g.
  `onPieceDrop({ sourceSquare, targetSquare, piece })` returning `boolean`.

Full detail: `docs/vendor/react-chessboard/G_UpgradeToV5.mdx`.

## 7. Checklist for a new board screen

- [ ] `options` typed as `ChessboardOptions`, unique `options.id` set.
- [ ] `chess.js` instance in a `useRef`; position mirrored to state via `fen()`.
- [ ] `onPieceDrop` (and/or `onSquareClick`) wraps `chess.js` `.move()` in
      `try/catch` and returns the correct boolean.
- [ ] Promotion handled properly, or an explicit `// demo shortcut` comment if
      hardcoding `'q'`.
- [ ] If using the engine: lazy ref, subscribe-in-effect + unsubscribe,
      `terminate()` on unmount, score normalized by turn.
- [ ] If using spare pieces: `ChessboardProvider` with the options on **it**,
      the palettes inside it, and `piece.isSparePiece` / a `null` `targetSquare`
      handled in `onPieceDrop` (§5).
- [ ] If anything shares the board square with the board (an eval bar, a
      palette): its size and the gaps sum to exactly the constant subtracted
      from the board's side, and the board box has `flexShrink: 0` (§5).
- [ ] Any `setTimeout` / async work cleared on unmount.
- [ ] `tsc -b` clean, `yarn test:run` green, `yarn lint` adding no findings.

## 8. Testing a board screen

**Stub `<Chessboard>` in Vitest.** jsdom has no layout engine, so the board
measures a zero-sized square and throws `Square width not found` from a mount
effect — an uncaught exception that fails the whole test file, not just the
assertion that touched it. Tests are about the screen *around* the board, so
mock the component and assert the position it was handed:

```tsx
vi.mock('react-chessboard', () => ({
  Chessboard: ({ options }: { options: { position?: string } }) => (
    <div data-testid="board" data-position={options.position} />
  ),
}));
```

The type-only `import type { ChessboardOptions }` in the component under test is
erased at compile time, so the mock does not have to provide it. Anything that
depends on the board actually rendering — sizing, drag, arrows — belongs in a
browser check, not in jsdom. `views/tools/editor/BoardEditor.test.tsx` is a
worked example; the v2 boards share one stub, `reactChessboardMock` in
`views/dev/devTestHarness.tsx`.

**Stub whatever the screen actually imports.** A spare-piece screen reaches for
three exports, not one: the options go to `ChessboardProvider`, the palettes are
`SparePiece`s, and `<Chessboard>` takes nothing — so the stub keeps the options
from the *provider* and the board renders what it finds there.
`views/tools/editor/BoardEditor.test.tsx` is that version. A screen with the
captured-pieces strips reaches for one more: `defaultPieces`, which the strips
draw their icons with — provide it in the mock (any renderer keyed by the
twelve piece types; `reactChessboardMock` in `views/dev/devTestHarness.tsx`
is the worked example).

jsdom's CSS parser also drops properties it does not implement — `aspect-ratio`
among them — so a `toHaveStyle` assertion on one silently fails. Assert the
constant that can drift (the width `calc`) and leave what the browser makes of
it to a browser check.
